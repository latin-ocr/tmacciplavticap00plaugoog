nocte 100 ln 127), or, as here, to the immediate future. recon-

ciliasscrc: a form oi the future infinitive found in a few verbs 01 ,

the first conjugation (cf. oueruncosscre, impetrassem, oppugnassere).
Τ110 origin oi this form is problematioal. See note on 33.

169. eccum: ie. ecce eam,· eom, eos, eos, ec, illum, etc, are
similarly combined into eccam, eccos, etc. The accusative seems to
be due to the general objective feeling involved in ecce, which, with its
accusative, is often used without reference to the construction of the
rest oi the sentence, eg. Ter. Plorat. 484, cecatur ob 0000 palaestro
ecit sorus,· Plaut. Mil. 1281, nescio qais 0000000 incedit. 1100000010
commonly used 01 a person already in sight, but see, in addition 10 the
present passage, 1015 ; Ant. 120; Aul. 7813 Bacch. toa. eccum
hic: the initial 10, as frequently in Plautus, preventa elision, and
makes the preceding syllable long. See Introd. ξ 74, and App.

171. hoc: ablative; see note on qut in 28. pote: (so. esse)
used here ior posse. Either potis or pote may be used in early Latin
as nominative or accusative, and as singular or plural.

172. faxint: ie. 10000101, such archaic forms long continued to
be used as favorite forms in prayers, just as early forms oi expression
have preserved themselves in English3 eg. “ pr kingdom 00000,”
“ Thy will be doae,” eto. The perfect tense in its future uses disre-
gards the progress of the act, and conceives oi it as one that is to be
promptly and energetically performed and linished (ci. the English
“be gone!'’ instead 01 “go l'’). This tense is accordingly used in
prayers only where the speaker is, or pretends to be, stirred with such
emotion at the thought 01 the possible occurrence oi the act that he
cannot think of the progress of it, but only the prompt accornplish-
ment oi it. Formal or indifferent prayers take the present tense.
See App. quo: capabiliter, though the English now uses ovipaobere
in this sense. foras: see note on 114.

173. nusquam: sometimes, as here, used in early Latin in the
sense oi no ubitber, where we should expect 0000 0000000000,ι 11 is com·
monly used oi rest in, instead 01 motion toward, aplace. Such con-
fusion 01 meanings is common enough in colloquial language, ci. intus
’ usually 00011010, but used also in the sense of from 00011010 (eg. Most.
675); peregre may indicate, in Plautus, rest in, motion 10, or motion
from. quod sciam: 11001 Ι furrow os (so for os I 1000000) ,· scium
istite subjunctive used in a restrictiva clause which itseli represents
a development from a clause of characteristic.

1⁷4. tu: used for emphasis, and 10 contrast with id: 0000010 Q
ask Q? mist: is. mi ert (mi tormini).
