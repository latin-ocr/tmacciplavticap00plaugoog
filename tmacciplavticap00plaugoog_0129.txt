mas 3] PROLOGVS. 65

he received from his enemies, those to the plays oi Plautus show a great
variety oi subject matter and commonly explain the plot oi the play.

1. hos: this leads one to expect a verb tc follow, of which it is to
be the object or the subjectaccusative, but the anacoluthon in the next '
verse leaves this pronoun without government. The accusative might
however be explained by supposing it tc be attracted to agree with
quos.

2. 1111 qui astant, -hi stam ambo, etc: similar humor might be
brought out in English: “These bystanders there-they are standing,
both ol them-the ‘standers’ aren't seated.” This good-natured at-
tempt tc cheat the spectatore out of the interesting information the
prologue had led them tc bebeve was coming would in itseli tend to
put them in good humor. One might have expected i, instead oi hi.
See App. n the text is correct, there is hiatus aiter qui.

3. testu estis: equivalentto testamint; hence the infinitiva loqui.

4. hic: with a gesture toward Hegio’s house. huius: witha
gesture toward Tyndarus

5. ειῐό sibl: the sibi intensiiies the idea oi stabnt at the same
time lays stress upon the interests involved in the possession and in
the general situation ; ipsius might have taken the place oi sito sihi,
but that would have concemed itsell only with the idea oi possession.

6. operam datie: starts with the idea, psit forth αο affort ,· accord-
ing to the application oi this idea to various situations it may be trans-
lated render service, take puina, or (as here) pice attention.

8. alterum: tc be pronounced citrino, ci. such phenomena in
English as “ev’ry,” “quiv'ring,” etc, for “every'‘ “quivering,''
etc: ci. also note on 306. The “iambic law '’ does not apply tc such
cases (see Introd. ᾖ 84), a'nd the scansion biterrim qaod is not permissi-
ble. seruos: nominative. The nominative and accusative singular ·
of the second declension end in the earliest times in ·os and -οοι, These
endings became ·us and -am toward the close of the third century nc,
except in words in which they were preceded by ο (either vowel or
consonant). See Introd. §86 (c); ci. note on sistunt, 81. surpuit:
by syncope, for sumpsit.

9. eum: to be pronounced eiam. profugiens: the present par-
ticiple here refers to an act prior tc that ci the principal verb ; strictly,
it should referto an act going on at the time ci the selling, but even
Latin, and especIally colloquial Latin, is sometimes inaccurate in its
use of tenses. The lach of a perfect active participle is often respon-
sible ior such a use as this; accuracy is sacrificed in the interest oi
brevity. uendidit: for the long final syllable, see Introd. ξ 82 ( ).
