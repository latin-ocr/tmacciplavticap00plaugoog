2. Predioating an aot actually performed, or a state actually
existing (a type developed from 1):1 11 111 qni mentiatur, he 11 e
man who 010111. Sometimes such a clause is used 01 the iuture;
ag. 613, gemet quoi neque pes neque eaput compareat, lte will
rattle off something, 10 which there will appear neither head nor
tait.

3. Predicating obligation or propriety (a type probably also
developed from 1): nihil eye uideo qnod pendeas, Isee teotbtny
that you should ought to rejoe’ee over.

4. Volitive. The relative clause, besides characterizing the ante-
cedent, may at the same time express the purpose 01 the aot 01 the
principal clause, as in the English sentence, “Men are trying 10
make machinos that shall² fly’'; here the dying 01 the maohines
is the aet which the men purpose 10 bring about, and at the same
time the dying is 10 characterize the machinos -they are 10 be
flying machinas. Oi. Tae. 11101, 28. 6, onies . . . conemitteretnr.

Another type of volitlve characterizing clause is represented by

· hio est loeas ebt· sedeas, which may have originated in some such
paratactio use as 110 111 loeas ,· hie sedeas (here is 0 ploce ,· sit here,
is yon lilte), where sedeas would be a wealr jussive subjunctive, ex-
pressing mere permission.

13. mendloarler: play the hesper, i.e. by asking lavors of you,
by making personal entreatles, which the 10101 regards as beneath his
dignity. The passive infinitivo in -111, 101 the olassioal -1, 11 very oom-
mon in early Latin, especially at the end 01 1 verse.

14. ego me tua: the juxtaposition 01 these pronouns heightens
the emphasis (see Introd. ξ 99) and the swaggering tone: ζ ent not
potae to hetrst m-ysetf sor Q-don’t fect yoursets. tua: to be
read 11101111 see Introd. §5 ’18 and 84. ne erres: see translation
iu the preceding note. Perhaps, however, this clause denotes negative
pmpose. rupturus: 10111111101111111110111111111111, 01. Plant.
101101 Poen. 540 ; hiere. 138; Ter. Hes. 435; Cio. ed som. VII. 1.
4; Ηο1. Ep. Ι. 19. δ.

15. qul potestis ope uestra oenserler: 10100011 eloim epleee
amone men of means ,· literally‚ who 0011 he reted hy your weelth.

¹This is the type 01 clause commonly designated as the ‘⁴ clause 01
characteristic.'’

²“ Shall ” isused here 10 indicato the determination 01 the men; “will'’
would indicate mere futurity without connoting any other idea.
