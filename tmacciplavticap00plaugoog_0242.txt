latin composition.

By Professor CHARLES E. ΒΕΝΝΕΠ, Cornell Universiry. nomo,
eloth, ¹7² peges. Price, so cents.
lllS book has been prepared with the conviction that the
primary function of Latin Composition in secondary schools
is to extend and strengrhen the pupil's knowledge of Latin gram·
mar. Accordingly, the lessons are devoted mainly to exercises
in applying the principles of the various case and mood construc-
tions recognized in our Latin Grammars. ln order that the
writing of continuous discourse may not be neglected, passages
of simple English narrative, involving the principles covered in
the previous exercises, are frequently introduced.

Grammatical references are to Bennett, Allen δι Greenough,
and Harlrness.

The illustrative examples given at the beginning of each lesson
have been drawn with great care from Latin literature- mainly
from Cicero's speeches. The English sentences set for transla-
tion into Latin have also, in most cases, been suggested by pas·
sages occurring in the works of classica] authors.

J. Bdmund Barsa, Hotckkiss Sckool, Lakevllle, Conn.: 1 have been using
Bennett's Latin Composition with a class reading Virgil. 1 have found it
a thoroughly usable book, both with the author's and with other standard
grammars; and l am especially pleased with the successful union of
interest with practical filness in the sentences.

Professor S. C. illitchell, Rickmond College. Vn: It is the most sensible
and helpful book of its lrind that has corne into my hands.
