Pica 21] Acr 11. sanun a. 105

(2) Just, preciselra a meaning developed from a restrictiva appli-
cation of the one just indicated (to that pollet, aad οο further,
which would easily come to suggest the general idea oi precision) ;

(3) ιο lbet (ead), reitb ο vieto ιο eber ,·

(4) in addition ιο ι1ιοι,ἱ.ο. furtbermora mareotes, besides. In
this last sense, the thing added is sometimes (especially in the
phrase atque odeo) opposed to the preceding context, when it may
be translated still.

quoi concredat: a predicating characterizlng clause oi the original
type3 see note on 12. hodie: this particle seems ιο be often used
in early Latin asa mere formality‚ without temporal force. Perhaps
the nearest English parallel is the colloquial use -of “now '³ in such
expressions as “he did not say so at all, now‚’' “ you’ll never get cii
like that, now.'’ Sometimes this colorless bodie seems untranslata·
ble; in this passage it is commonly translated ever, though it probably
has no temporal force. audacius: with preater corrfideace.

³49. ne uereare: see note on 331. periclo: risle.

350. ingenio: disposition. elue: ἶιῖιο. erga: this post·
positive use οι erpo is chiefly anteclassical, and is most common with
me, te, se.

351. ilde: paorcatee.

352. quam cltiseume potest, tam: for the more common οοοοι
potest tam with a positive, or qaum ctttssume alone. cedere ad

See App.

353. causa quin. . . dee: reason uby you should οοι give.
Quin is composed of qui, bow? or why i and the negative particle ab
(which in early times was used in the sense of οοο); it here retains
its original meaning. quin. . . dee: wbp you sbould οοι pice,
an indirect questiones obligation‚ or propriety. See note on 208.
uiginti minae: about sabb. Such estimates‚ however, in terms of
modern money are based merely on-equivalence in weight oi coin,
without any reference to the relative purchasing power oi the amount
inquestion.

354. optume—immo: οοι οι all-the best of reasons rabber
(ecby laborem), optuma agreeing with caetae understood, with which
car· dem is easily supplied. This position oi immo is very unusual
before Livy ; in answering a question it commonly stands first.
