all. The same is true of all the early editions prior to that
of Pylades (1506). It is only during the present century
that most of the laws governing these early metres have
been discovered. Even yet many difficulties remain, and· it
is frequently impossible to determine definitely the char-
acter of individua] verses or the points at which verse·
division should be made. In the deprecator instance,
there are twenty verses (212, 232-234, 497-515, 836) which
the recent critical edition of Goetz and Sohoell makes no
attempt to assign to definite matres. On account of the
difficulties of I'lautineandTe1·entian metres, it hae, since
the time of Bentley, been customary for each editor to
mark the main, or primary, ictuses in each verse, in order
to indicate what seems to him individually, orto editors

(a) arsis, used in this book to indicate the unaccented part
of a foot.

(b) thesis, used in this book to indicate the acoented part

Ι of a foot. (See, however, note on p. xlv.)

(c) diaeresis, that sort of division (within averse) which is
caused by the coincidence of the end of a word with
the end of a foot, ag. in the verse—

there is diaeresis after creuit and again after Hesperus.
(d) Meum, the coming together of two vowels (each with
its own natural quantity), caused by the nonelision
of a final vowel before a word beginning with a
vowel or Ιι (but see Intrcd. ἓ 74).
(e) semi-hiuma, the occurrence of a final long vowel, or a
diphthong, before a word beginning with a vowel or
