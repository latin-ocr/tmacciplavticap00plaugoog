113. For the punctuation after istas, instead 01 after sinyulart'as,
see Bach, Studemund's Studien, II. (1896) p. 322.

120-121. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 289) argues that a line
must have dropped out between these lines. ¹

121. Schrader conjectures nien 101 mene and ipsus for ipse; see
Dissertationes Aryentoratenses, VII. p. 263. On the supposed use 01
-ne in the sense 01 nonne, see Morris in Am. Jour. of ΡΜ, XI. pp.
1911.

136-137. Regarded as interpolatione by Karsten (Mnemosyne,
XXI. p. 19811).

139. For the justification of the statement made in my notes, to
the effect that there is no such thing in Latin as anegative question 01
deliberation, see Tite Latin Prohibitioe (Am. Jour. os Phil, XV. pp.
313 ff.); also Cornell Studien in Classical Philoloyy, VI. pp. 213 ff.

151. Bor quom (cunr) in the sense of tlte saci that, see, e.g., Hele,

with references there given.

15⁷. quod optiyerat: the editors who 'retain this line at all, fol-
low Camerarius in changing quod to quoi, but see my note. The
reading of ‘the Mss. seems as likely to be right as any one of the
numerous conjectures.

169. Intus is commonly added before Aleum, on metrical grounds,
but unnecessarily. See my note and Birt (Rbein. Mus. 1011899,
p. 61).

172. For the force 01 the perient tense ln prayers, etc, see my
Stadios tn Latin Moods and Tenses (Cornell Stadios in Classical

in Classical Philoloyy, IX, and for an answer to this critique, see
American Journal os Pltiloloyy, XXI. (1900).

175. Ι follow Leo in retaining the reading 01 the Mas. te

uocari. The usual emendation (a te uocari) misses the wit of Ergasi- ·
lus’ words, referred to in the next line, and is less in harmony with ,

rrum uocatus es? in 173. See note.
179-181. See Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 303).
