118 NOTES. [Pecu 50

882. iem diu: now long sicce, to be taken with the preceding
surripuit. The idea is so improbable that Hegio thinks there must be
some mistake about it. Diu commonly means sora long time, but
frequently in early Latin, aud occasionally later, it is used as in the
present passage, in the sense of tono apo. See App.

883. tilde eis: careybl now ,· literally, ece to it, piceae (thot you do
not deceive tite).

884. tu: emphatic. barbaricas: i.e.1talian; see note on 492.
enlm: see note on 534. asperae: rude, “ toupb‚” ajoke at the ex-
pense oi the towns mentioned, which were at the time very unpopular
at Rome. Aspersa may refer tc the rude character oi the people 01
their language, or possibly to the rugged character of the sites oi the
towns.

885. autumabas: viz. in 188; cf. 497. uae aetati tuae: woe
be 111110 your! literally, woe to your ltye. Vae here forms an exception
to the rule that monosyllabic interjectione are not elidad.

886. quippe quando: (you may weil say “uoe be uicto yoo‘')
since, indeed, etc. Quippe is frequently thus used with causei par-
ticles and causal relative clauses, for greater emphasis. 1111111 nil
credie, quod, etc: you prout nte nc confideuce tu echert I say iu ull
ecrucstness; nil is the accusative oi the “ inner object '² (“ result pro-
duced'’); that with reference to which nc confidence is felt is the
antecedent to be supplied for quod. Such an antecedent might be in
the genitive case, as seen from passages like the following: Asin. 459,
quiet cerintum rerum ipsus sentpcr credit,¹ Troo. 307, quanquam mibi
piusquam posthoc (letarum rerum crederit.

887, Stalagmus : the person is thrust upon the attention first, the

. question about him follows, just asin English wc·migl1t say, “this
Stalagmus—of what nationality was he?'' quoius: gemtus.
abit: in early Latin the historical present is often found after quom,
as well as after postquem ,· see 282 ; Arva. 668 ; Stich. 511 ; Epid. 217 ;
Most. 253 Meu. 1054, etc.
· 888. boiam terit: he's a captive ,· literally, be mearco boia, i.e.a
wooden or iron collar put about the neck of prisoners; but Boia means
also a Boian woman (the Boii were apeople just south of the Po), and
Boium terit, therefore, means also hc hus u Boiuu wisc, 01 a Boion
10011101 bus taken him captive, it is with reference to this double
meaning of the phrase that Ergasilus playfully says, Boius cet, he'ec
Boion 11010.

889, liberorum quaerundorum: alluding to his propensity for
acquiring children, shown in his having stolen Hegio's little bey.
