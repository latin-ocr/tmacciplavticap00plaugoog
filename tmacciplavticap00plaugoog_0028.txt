works was drawn from the actors’ copies of the plays, so
far as they could be procured, and from the recordo of
magistrates regarding the productione of plays brought out
under their supervision. Consideration for the convenience
of the reader led to the practice of indicating at the begin-
ning of each scene the characters who take part in that
scene, and of dividing plays into acts (see p. xxx). But,
after a time, interest in the performances of the early
drama began to flag, and in the Augustam period not merely
had such performances ceased to be popular, but so little
interest was felt in Plautus himself that his plays now
found but few readers, and the copies produced during this
period were carelessly and indifferently made. Many of
the corruptions in the text undoubtedly date from this
period of indifference. It was during this period, als0, that
the plays became separated from one another, each going
its own way through the hands of copyists, and each meet
ing with its own iate. This independent circulation of
individual plays accounts in part for the marked differences
in the condition of the texts. Some plays passed through

still full cf the corruptions they then received; others fell
into worthier hands, and have come down to us in amore
satisfactory form5 but all alike were less carefnlly treated
than would have been the case if a livelier and a more
general interest had been felt in the author. This period
cf indifference toward, and neglect of, the plays of Plautus
lasted till about the second half of the first century nn.
