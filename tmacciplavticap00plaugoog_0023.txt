only, as yet, 10 that 01 Plautus. He died soon after
Ennius, with whom in life he had been on the most inti·
mate terms. ,

11. Publius Terentius Afer was born at Carthage, about

190 rac.1 At an early age, he came to Rome as a slave 01
the senator Terentius Lucanus. His master, struck by the
talent and the prepossessing appearance 01 the boy, not
only caused him tc be carefully edueated, but also gave him
his freedcm. The associations to which he had been acoris-
tomed in the house 01 his master made it easy for him to
keep up his connectione with the nobility 01 Rome, and cer·
tain prominent members 01 this nobility became his firm
friends Chief among these were Scipio Africanus (the
younger), C. Laelius, and L. Furius Philus. ,
12. The literary tendency 01 the times, as well as his
own inclinatior, led the poet to devote his activity to
the salillo palliato. Terence produced his first eomedy,
the Andria, at the ludi Megalenses, in April, 166 nc. The
aediles, who had charge 01 the gemes, had some misgivings -
about allowing the presentation 01 0 play by an entirely
unknown poet. He was accordingly induced to submit his
play first to the older poet Caecilius, 101 approval. Regard-
ing the meeting between these two poets, the following
story is told. Terence found Caecilius at dinner, and, as
the caller was meanly dressed, he was given a seat 011 0
bench near the couch on which the great author was reclin-
ing, and was then given permission to read what he had
written. After the first few verses had been read, Caecilius
was so captivated by the young man's talents that he in-
vited him to a place beside him upon the couch. He then
listened attentively and with unbounded admiration to the
remainder 01 the play.

1 The date generally given is 185, in accordanoe with Suetonius, in
his cita Terenti ,· but H. Sauppe (Noclr. d. (lille. pce, 1870, pp. 111 fi.)
has made this date seem very improbable.
