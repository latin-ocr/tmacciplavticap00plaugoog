porra-selam) ; literally‚ aad by pour dispositione to ntclee tt cosp for (or
in respect to) tlte charter’s control also.

201. oculis multa miraclitis: unintelligible; possibly Plautus
wrote stultam iram editis, you arc taattt'sestiap plenty of atrpcr lny your
eyes. See App. ’·

202. si. . . utare, adiuuat: ior some reason not yet understood, a
condition in which the subiect ot the verb is an indefinite second pcr-
son takes the subjunctive, though the apodosis takes the indicative.
When the subject is an indefinite third person (e. g. puts), ou the other
hand, the protasis takes the indicative.

203. This line offers agood illustration oi the two oonnnon uses

’ oi at: (i) to introduce an obJectiou to some one's statement, (2) to
introduce the reply to such an objection. noe pudet quia: such
passages as idac pudet te qaia (Epic. 107) make it probable that the
quia-clause is a substantive clause and that quia here means tlte fact
that. See note on 153. cum catenis: where we should say ta
chains; the Latin expression treats the chains as forming an accom-
paniment.

204. pigeat...nostrnm erum: A.&G.221. b‚c 3 B. 209; G.-L.
377; H. 409, 111.; 457.

205. solutos sinat: an expression exactly parallel in form to our
‘⁴ let loose‚’' though esse is probably to be understood with the Latin ;
it differs from solui sinat in calling attention to the state resulting irum
the act, rather than to the act itself. emerit: the mood may be duc
to attraction, or it may be due to the causei-adversative idea involved ;
the quos. . . eruerit gives the reason ior saying pipcct (it 'warchi he veert-
tious, etc, Q lte has paid money sor them), but it has at the same
time an adversative relation to et solutos sinat (ry he should let thera
loosc arrd tacut· tlte risle os testrep thera, tu spite of the-sa-ct-tbgtt they
have cast motem). Causal and adversative qui-clauses probably origi-
nated in the clause of characteristic.

206⁵. a: see Introd. § 84. ecimu(e) nos: as the last foot must
be a pure iambus (Introd. ᾗ 39), it is clear that the s oi scitatis vvas
slighted in pronunciation. nos: emphatic tce.

206! quod est: what it t's; in Cicero we should expect quat stt.
The indicative isvary frequently found in indirect questions in early
Latin. The reason for this may be that they are not as yet iar removed
irom paraturis-a theory that is supported by the fact that, with
comparatively rare exceptione, these indicative indirect questions are
suchas might actually be interpreted as independent. Eg. Ter. Pharia.
