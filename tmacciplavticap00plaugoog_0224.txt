Accordingly, uo verb whose meaning is opposed 11 this idea is found

72-73. Τ11 repetition oi scortum in 73 has caused most editors to
suspectacorrupcion in the text. Therepetitionissufficientlyaccounted
ior by Ergasilus' evident desire to lay all possible emphasis upon the
point that he is making. He is contending that, in spite oi what the
derisores say, it is periectly appropriate that he should be called
ιι31111111”; sor, he says, 111 bis scorteae thet the lover 11111111, when

¹34. Scortum is inserted by Bentley aiter irtaocetere. 1 have not
incorporated it into the text, but I believe it to be correct, for the iol-
lowing reasons: (1) it is certain that a word has dropped out ; (l)
scortum has to be mentally supplied, in any case, to make sense, even
ii omitted from the text ; (3) the preceding lines show that the
speaker is making the most oi this word by constant repetition and hy
centering the thought upon it; (4) the word would easily be omitted
hya scribe, who, glaucing up from his copy for a moment, alter reading
iaaocotara would, upon turning again 11 his copy, mistake the -1111 ci
scortum for the last syllable copied, and would begin writing again
with 11 111, etc. The loss of <cett 111), supplied by Camerarius,
could not be so easily accounted for.

77-83. Karsten (1111111111, XXI. p. 296 i.) regards 77-79 and
rebus. . . miseri, incoenata, as interpolatione.

⁷⁷. This line is commonly regarded as spurious (see, for instance,
Spengel, Philolcpas 37, 421 ; Brix, ed 111,· Langen, Plautia. Studien,
p. 271), but, it seems 11 me, without sufficient reason. Niemeyer de·
sends it (Zeitschrlsts. cymnawelaeeear0r1885‚ p. 361).
