INTRODUC'I'ION.

4. For subjunctive in deliberative questions: quid
‹ryol certat shall Idci (instead of quid warni) Cf. the
English expression, “What do I do now (next) ? ’'

(b) Suby‘unctive: 1. Absque with the ablative and esset
(soret), to represent a condition contrary to fact:
Men. 1022, ubsque te esset, were it not sor you.

2. Ne with the perfect subjunctive in prohibitione
is common in Plautus, though very rare later (except
in Cicero’s Leders). It is energetic and unceremoni·
cus, and therefore colloquial.

95. Tensesz-

(a) Preserd .· 1. The present indicative is often loosely used
where strict accurscy would require the future or the
future perfect: Stich. 623, deos salutabo modo: posteud
te contiuuo transeo ; Pers. 275, etium respicis (worc't you
look arnaud 2) ,· Capi. 331, eum si reddis midi, praeterea
uuum reuisurum ue duis (for si reddideris, etc).

2. The present subjunctive, instead of the imper·
fect, is sometimes used in conditional sentences,
where the condition is apparently contrary to fact:
As. 393, si sit domi, diceus tibi.

(b) Future perfect: The future perfect is frequently used,
not as a true future perfect to indicate an ast to be
finished prioris some future time, but as an ener-
getic future to indicate prompt completion of the
act ct afuturo time: Bacch. 211, abiero, Ι 'il be off;
Trin. 1007, lubet obseruare quid dyst: duc concessero.
Here the force of the tense in huc concessero should
be brought out in translation by using an expression
that connotes the idea of hurried accomplishment, eg.
I 'll step iliis way, I 'll dodye irc here, or the like. The
simple future might always be used in such a case,
but there is avery distinct difference intono between
the two tenses.
