uns a ⁴·son oi the iamily’' inillis, the uec secere erut, etc, was
literally true and the condition et essem . . . filius was not contrary
to iact at all. The spectatore oi course are thoroughly enjoying this
hoodwinking oi Hegio.

talento: this pun is interesting as an item of prooi that the θ ot θαλῆς

the earliest oi the Greek philosophers, and one oi the seven wlse men.
talento non emam: l rcould not talea (literally‚ huy) at a tutent, ie.
ii 1 could get him ior a talent (1 have a iar better wise man in Philo
crates). Notice that the present subiunctive here, by implicationes
a result oi an omitted protasis, seems to mean I ruorrld buy (involving
the will). strictly speaking, the idea is Ι should buy (merely a con·
clusion to an “ideal'’ “less vivid future ’' condition, i.e. should do

oi the pun more than oi anything else. But' see App.

crates, in the character oi Tyndarus, is willing to give him every
encouragement, and proceeds to paint himself in very satisfactory
colors. genere: surully. Polypluslo (πολύ, fioletum: the
