second syllable 01 a word 01 three 01111016 syllables may be shortened,
even when it is long by nature (see Introd. 5 84, 4). At any rate,
such phenomena are so frequently presented by Μ11. that one cannot
lightly dismiss them as not worth considering. See the readings 01

shortening in Plautus, in trisyllabic words alone (though a few of
these instances do not properly belong in his list), and many similar
instances in longer words. When the second syllable is long hy posi-

such instances in trisyllabic words 111 Plautus, and many others in
longer words. Under these circumstances, Ι have allowed the reading
