mas io] ner n. sonna ο. 95

gives a tone of pertness: Q taken uviyhty good core that ue
shouldn’t lituu up missing-I sec Q ; this emphasis upon “ that “’
reproduces the emphasis brought out by the position of the clauso
ne . . . essemus, which would normally follow the word upon which
it depends (cf. 255, couci ue, etc). in quaestione: in prenesti-
oue esse is used in the sense of to be colesium literally, το be (the
oue soupht) iu c search. Similar expressions are common in Plau·
tus; ag. Pers. 523 Pseud. 663; Mil. 1279; Trlu. 278·; Oisl. 5933
Cas. 530.

254. uinclis: such forms, uinclum, saeclum, periclum, etc, are the
earliest forms and are more common in Plautus than colliculum, sue-
culum, pert’culum. The parasitis u between the ο and l arose froin
an (unconscious) effort to facilitate the pronunciation. circum-
moeniti: with moeuire for the later muttire, cf. coercuit for coercuit
(U. Ι. L. I. 600), loedos for ludos (O. Ι. L. 1. 567), etc. Instead of oc
in such words, oi is frequently found, and both oi and oe continued to
be used in inscriptions even in classieal times.

255. The humor from this point on throughout tho scene cannot
fail to be appreciated by any one who keeps in mind the general
situation

256. cautor captus est: the october (literally, the worp orie)
finds himself caught. One must not mistake coptus est for a gnomic
perfect (aorist), a use of the perfect tense that is first found in the
poets of the classical period, who horrowed it from the Greeks. Here
est alone is the verb, the coptus being used in the predicate to express -
the state.

257. an: au commonly introduces the second part of adisjunctive
question, but in early Latin and even in the poets of the classical
period it is frequently used as a simple interrogative. The same use
is occasionally found in Livy and later prose. ut: cler would be
more common after causa.

258. aim mercatus: the subjunctive may be due to any one of
these causes (or to all combined), viz.: (1) to a desire to represent
the quos-clause aa the indirectly reported thought suggested (by the
question) to the minds of the persons addressed; (2) to a desire to
emphasize the causal relation of the quosclause to the clause upon
which it depends (see App.); (3) to the fact that it depends upon
another subjunctive.

259. tibi . . ‚uitio uertere: lo lap u up occlusi uou,· literally,
tc turn u uiuo pou sor c fault. quia= (the sect) thot; see note
011153.
