maa 4ο] sor 1v, sonna 2. 141

drinln prolecto: contrasted with miro edepol sant ot in 805.
confidentiam: see note 011805.

813. piscatores: for the construction, see note on pistores in 801 .

814. aduehnntur: rideup.

815. odos: early form for oller ,· cf. arbos, labos, ior orbor, labor.
An original a between two vowels regularly became r; hence the origi-
nal odoais‚ odori, etc, became odolla, oclori, ete, and after the analogy
of such forms in the other cases the nominative odos became odor..
Moncsyllables like yles, enos, etc, resisted this change in the nominative.
subbasilicanos: tlte arcade-loaopers, aab· calling attention ιο the root
above them. A basilico was a large open building, the floor space ol
which was divided into aisles by rows of colonnadeS, and which was
used asa hall ο1 justice and as a public meeting place, sarving, in some
respecta, the purposes ο1 a modern “town hall.'’ The first basilica
mentioned as existing in Rome was the Basilica Porcia, built by Cato
the Censor in 184 nc, the year iu which Plautus died. Plautus must
here have in mind an earlier basilica, ο1 which no account hasbeen
preserved. For Roman allusione in Plautus, see note on 34.

817. alieno naso: to other peoplc’a acces.

818822. See App.

818. concinnant: not uncommon in Plautus in the sense ο1 red-
dere, ovele, render. liberis: little onea; literally, children ‚· used
here ο1 the young oi sheep to give a touch ο1 pathos. Ergasilus is
trying to heighten the enormity ο1 the offences ο1 which the leoli are
guilty and thus enhancing his own menits in proposing ιο trounce
them.

819. qni locant caedundos agnos: ie. who contraot to furnish
the publio with lamba that are ιο be iat and tendor ; literally, vrbo
controct for lornbs aa fit lo be sloapbterecl. The emphatic position
ο1 locant is due to a design to contrast strongly the idea ο1 locoat with
that of danunt—what they agree to do, with what they actually do.
For another instance of caedundus in this sense, see Aul. 567, where
Megadorus upon being accused ο1 having bought a leau and unsuitable
lamb for a feast, replies caeduallam conduct epo illem, I bouelt (coo-
trectedsor) thot lomb os oue fit sor lcilllop (ie. ior eating). See App.
duplam agninam danunt: eloethe public twice os atereth lomb (os they
opreecl to), ie. lamb twice as old-old sheep instead ol genuine lamb.
Another interpretation is commonly given, but see App. danunt:
arehaic for ‹lent; nequinont occurs for aeqlceuat, and obinunt (for
obeant) is mentioned by Festus ; ci. also the o in cer-oc, lla-o, sia-o,
etc, as compared with their perfecte creat, lteri, alal, etc.
