¹stage the plays of former poets. It was but natural that
many changes should be made in these old plays to make
them better suited to the altered conditione under which
they were to be reproduced. The text oi Plautus has suf-
fered not a little by the arbitrary changes that were made
for such purposes. His plays continued to be put on the
stage for a, long time after the poet's death, and there can
be no doubt that they are preserved to us in the form which
they received to fit them for these later reproduetions. Some
of the prologues now prefixed to the plays may have been
written ior performances given about the middle of the first
century rao.l To about the same time probably belong the
¹ aurosne arguments, or metrical summaries, prefixed to all the
plays of Plautus ericept the Bacchides. For the non-aorosne
arguments, which belong to a later period, see p. xxiii. . As
early as the second half of the second century no, scholars
began, in imitation and emulationes the Greek grammarians,
to turn their attention to the study of fobrclce palliatae. The
texts of the comediaus were brought together in suitable
form for reading, special care being taken to preserve, as
far as possible, different readings wherever such existed.
Notes, t00, on the history of the different plays were col-
lected and arranged in a connected manner. Lastly, Roman
scholars wrote various treatises cn the scenio and linguistic
peculiarities of the old comedians, and on other topics of
interest to the student of literature Among these were
Is Accius (the famous writer oi tragedy), Porcius Licinus,
Volcacius Sedigitas, L. Aelius Stilo, Aurelius Opilius, Q. cos·

conius, Serv. Clodius, and, above all, M. Terentius Varro,
whose works, distinguished as they were for their learning
and practical wisdom, formed the chief source of informa-
tion for the historiens of literature. The material for these
