NOTES.

ARGUMENTUM.

The argumento prefixed to the plays of Plautus are not the produc-
tions oi that poet, but were written in a later age, during a revival oi
interest in archaic Latin. See Introd. §21- Such brief summaries

were also written for other authors (eg. ior the different books oi '

Vergil’s Aeneid and for the plays oi Terence, hy Sulpicius Apollinaris
in the second century mm), the prosody aud the language oi tho author
in hand being in each case carefully imitated.

1. captust: ie. captus cst; final s aiter a short vowel was very
iaintly pronounced in early Latin. Coptos est would therefore easily
become capta' cst and then (by prodelision) captust. With this dis-
appearance oi the initial e, compare, eg. optumumst, ior optumam est,
in10; domist fordomt' est, ir129; the English it’s for it is, etc. On ·
the position of captust, see Introd. 599. Here captust sounds the key-
note oi the entire play, and accordingly takes the most prominent
place ior the verb. pugna Hegionis: probably notacase of hiatus.
H seems to hare been capable oi preventing elision and oi “making¹
position '’ after a final consonant. See Introd. § 74.

2, seruos: for the form, see Introd. ς 86 ( ).

i.e.Tyndarus.

subject is dominas, ie. Philocrates in the disguise oi aslave. ipsus:
for the classical ipsc.

8. ls: ie. Philocrates. tugitiuom: sce Introd. §86( ).

9. quoius: fortheclassical cuias,· Introd. §86 (b). allum: is.
Tyndarum, ctiam is here equivalent to ottemm.

PROLOGVS.

On the prologues to the plays oi Plautus, see Introd. ᾗ 19.

The rdle oi prologue seems to have been usually taken by ouo oi the
younger actors or by the manager 'oi the company, who was attired
for the occasion in a particular costuma. While the whole burden oi
the prologues oi Terence consists oi answers to the unkind criticlsms
