PERSONAE.

{ihu early Greek comedy seldom employed more than three actore,
but aiter the chorus was abolished this number was oiten exceeded.
With the exception oi the Cistellaria and the Sciebas, the plays oi
Plautus always require at least four ; those oi Terence require at least
five. In the Captivos four actors are necessary3 among these tlre parts
might be dhhibured as follows ι -

(1) Hegio.
2 Philocrates, Aristophontes, puer.
Tyndarus, Philopolemus, the toralias who speaks in Act 1. Scene 2.
Ergasilus, Stalagmus, the lorariae who speaks in Act II. Scene 1,
and Aet III. Scene 5.

Resides these, supemumeraries would be necessary, eg. in Act II.
Scene 1.

· The names in sabatae palliatae are commonly Greek names with
Latin forms. Such names are usually chosen as will in themselves
convey some idea oi the characters to whom they belong. For in-
stance, in the present play :-

Rgaessus indicates “the worker'’ (ἐργάζομαι), who “means busi-
ness'' and isnot to be trifled with. The reader should picture him in the
ordinary dress oi a parasite, ie. in black or gray garments oi outlandish
style, and whatever “austras” might add to his ridieulous appearance.

Hegio, “the prominent citizen,’‘ “the leading 111an’' oi the place
(ci. ἡγέομαι). This actor accordingly wears, with befitting dignity,
the usual dress oi a well-todo Greek.

Phllocrates, “fond of ruling.” Plautus himself probably spelled
this name Pilocrates3 see note on Talem in 274.

Aristophontes, “ killer oi chieis.” For the Plautina spelling, see
noteon274. .

Philopolemus, “the lover oi war” (φίλος, πόλεμος). For the
Plautina spelling, see note on 274.

Stalagmus, “the hopper.”
