193. opnd: Leo (Plentin. Forsan. pp. 226 ff.) argues that thed
iu opud was silent in cases like this.

trapeseitom .· this is probably the correct form for Plautus; see my
note. Harrington (Proceedn'nye of tlte American Philoloyicol Aesonia-
tion ior 1898, p. xxxiv.) argues that there was no letter 2, even in
the earliest LatIn alphabet. See Hempl's artIole on The Ortyin cf tlre
Latin Letters (l and Z in Transactione os the Am. Pnn. Ass, XXX.
p. 24.

194. icero .· Meifart (de snt. eoacti nen Pleni.) shows that thIs use
01 the future perfect, where one might expect the future, is found
chiefly at the end 01 a line or in diaeresis, and that the choloe 01 this
tense 10 frequently determined by metrieal convenience. lt must not,
however, be supposed that no difference was felt between the future
perfect and the future. Very often the energetic and the calm forms
01 expression (eg. “I’ll be σφ’ and “ I’ll yo ”) are equally appropri-
ate in the context. In such cases, metrioal convenience may deter-
mine the choico, but the differenoe between the tenses nevertheloss
remeius clear and distInct. See note.

199. Niemeyer (Plantin. Studien, pp. 611.) favors the reading et
erili imperto eamque inyeniie, ete. See Nettleship, Lectores ond
Ic'esoys, p. 3433 Karsten in Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 304. The reading 01
the Mes, however, may be correct after all (see my note).

201. Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 144) suggests Einldtt'dne malta

detrita meiito mera cietur. Ihave not been able to see what Schebor -

says 01 this passage in the Journal des lenis. rnss. Ministerinms der
Volkeanslridrany, Sept. 1891, pp. 57-843 Oct. pp. 1-7.

211. For another view regarding the etymology 01 arbiter, see Fay
in Vinson’s Reone de timeretque, 1898, pp. 373 ff.

217. The insertion 01 atque beiore ea seems the best 01 the various
emendations 01 this line.

243. 0000 nnnc: nnnc 10 commonly dropped by editors ; but see
my note.

244. quom: perhaps Plautus wrote qnoi. See Speijer iu Mnemo-
syne, XVI. p. 144.

246. perque: ior the pronunciation perp see Skutsch, Studien,
p. 152. Liudsey apparently rejects the possibility 01 the scansion
quod hostico (Journal os Plritoloyy, 22. p. 4).

250. It is quite possible that we should, with Speijer (Mnemosyne,
XVI. p. 140), read 'n ndo, instead 01 In hdo.

258. The impression, sometimes given by grammars, that oausal
