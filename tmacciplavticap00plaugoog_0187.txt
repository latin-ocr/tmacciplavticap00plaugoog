People of some localities similarly believe that spitting on coins will
bring good fortune. Interesting in this connection are certain passages
in the New Testament, eg. St. Mark 8. 23, “And he toolr the blind
man by the hand . . . ; and when he had spat 011 his eyes, . . . he
asked himif he saw aught’'; see also St. John 9. 6. The qui here is

not the relative, but merely an intensiiying particle, as in etqui
(et qni); see notes on 28 and 243. me: possibly Plautus wrote need,

in which case the d would be due to false analogy with the ablative;
see notes on 240, 405. insputarier: tc he epit repon.

554. multos: many ere the men whom, eto.

555. quibust dependent not upon insputari, but upon Jieit.
luit: the original length oi the e'r is here retained ; cf. scimus in
2623As.782;t1tl.754;136430tc. is: dative; see note on 494.
Notiee the change, very common in Latin, from the relative to the
demonstrative construction.

555. quid tu: bow (literally, what) about yon? With tu prob-
ably no particular verb was lelt to be omitted. autem: starting
with the meaning on tlte other bend, but, entem came to be frequently
used (as here) by the comio poete, in questions prompted by a feeling
of opposition, or reproach. It may be better translated by giving the
question a proper tone than by the use oi any particular word.
etiam eredis: cen it be thet yon believe? literally, you even believe?

. Etiam is often thus used in impatient questions, implying incredibility.
Possibly‚ however, etiem is here a temporal particle, equivalent to
adbuc, still.

557. uiden: i.e. uidesne. For the force of -ne, see note on 121.
tu hune: the 5 prevents elision. intuitur: from the archaic in-
tuor (= intueor); ci. Most. 836, 837 (operiere), 83ss (coetei); for the
mood‚ see note on 206⁵. concedi: sor nc to withdraw ‚· literally, it
to be withdrewn (by cs).

558. Hegio: probably to be read with synizesis, Hegio, though ·
synizesisofioinnounsisrare. flt: iecominpon. Seenpp.

559. credidi, extemplo: both emphatic by position, Ι tlt—ought
hercescrezyQ

560. quin . . . ignorat: aohy, lte doeen't know. Quin (qut ÷ nt
= why noti) and English why? came to be used merely to attract
attention to surprislng, or incredible, or particularly emphatic etate-
ments that are about to bc made. It will be notieed that aoby, when
thus used, is commonly pronouneed w'y. qul siet: the later dis-
tinction between quis and qui does not seem to have been observed in
early Latin. Even in classical times itissometimes disregarded. Τ59
