111111] 11111. scama 1. 149

891. gnatus: (sc. esse) here a participle 3 see note on 19.

892. ain tu: (1.1. aisne tal) merely a formula expressive of
indignation‚ wonder, or the like, what do poa maan, sir? It is here
prompted by Hegio’s si aera calamos. etiam, sancte quom . . .
iurem: when Ι would tale evea c solemn cath (is ashed to do so);
atlans sancte is given an emphatic position for the purpose of contrast-
ing his present mood with his previous inclination to jest· in taking
oaths (881 fi). For other interpretatione, see App. The mood oi
iurem is due tc the fact that it is felt, virtually‚ as the conclusion of a
“ contingent'' (“ less-vivid-future,’' “ ideal ”) condition 5 it is uninflu-
enced by quom, which in Plautus takes the indicative (see notes on
146 and244).

896. nam: (a compauper thina to do) sor. malmantiscinatus
probe ero: is I shall not (proca to) llaaa given an honest report; the
meaning, however, of mantiscinatus (a word occurring only here) is
doubtful.

898. unde ld: nl whose expensa is that to he done? literally‚
sahenas is that i The id refers to the whole idea of dapinabo uictam,
rather than to uictam alone (hence id instead cf is), but the question
seems rather pointless after the assurance just given by Hegio Erga-
silus is, however, using the formalities of a legal bargain (stipulatio)
and he wants to make sure that there will be no misunderstanding.

899. ego tuom tibi: notice the emphasis obtained by the J'uxta-
position of these pronouns. respondeo: Ι promise (assare aaa) ia

retarn; the word here has its etymological meaning, with a play, of
Δ course, upon its usual sense. 1

as hest yoa can; potesis frequently omitted in such cases. bene
ambula: see note on 452.
