IV.
DIVISION OF PLAYS ntro Acrs Atto SCEIOES.

³³. A division of dramas into acts was already known in
the time of Plautus and Terence, but it does not as a rule
seem to have been clearly marked by the writers them-

selves. It was left rather to the discretiori of the theatrical
manager to introduce intermissions at suitable places in the
play. , This is perhaps the reason why the manuscripts, at
least all the oldest of them, have no division into acts.
Definite divisione were, however, established by the gram-

marians and the commentators of antiquity (though these
sometimes differ among themselves), and five was settled
upon as the proper number of acts for a drama (cf. Horace, ’
A. P. 189 f).

³4. The division into soenes, on the other hand, is very
old. It was customary to place before each scene a com·
plote list of all the characters to appear in that particular
scene. In the copies which formed the basis of our manu-
scripts, each character who had anything to say was de
noted by a letter of the Greek alphabet, which letter served
also in the text to designate that character. For the divi-
sion into soenes, two principles seem to have been followed
in our manuscripts. According to one of these, a new
scene is formed by the exit or the entrance of a single
actor. Exceptions to this rule are formed by cases in which
aperson leaves the stage only for a moment, or in which the
persons who remain behind have little to say, and that of
no importauce, until the entrance of another actor, or other
