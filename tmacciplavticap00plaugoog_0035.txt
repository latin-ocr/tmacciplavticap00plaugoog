Greek town or colony, usually iu Athens. When the action
was supposed to be taking place in a town, the proscaenium
represented an open street in that town. The background
was ordinarily formed by three private houseS, correspond-

sometimes the front of a temple, when the character of the
play made such a building necessary. Narrow alleys also
opened from the back of the stage into the street (cf. Phoceu.
891 f.). Upon the stage stood, according to Donatus, two
altars — one on the right dedicated to Liber, another on the
left, dedicated to the deity chiefly concerned in the festivi-
ties of which the production of the play formed a part.
On this point, however, there are differences oi opinion.1
