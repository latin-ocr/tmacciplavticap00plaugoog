by a crier (praeco), that the people might assemble at the
proper place. Immediately before the performance began,
there was a tituli pronuntiatio, an announcement of the sub·
ject of the play; but sometimes the prologne itself conveyed
to the audienoc their first information regarding the subject
of the play and the name of the poet. The actors were
slaves, or, in later times, freedmen, this profession being
considered beneath the dignity of free-horn men. The
domiuus, or general manager of the troupe was a freedman,
who also took part in the acting and was sometimes called
the octor (ie. pur cacelleuce). At first, ‚poets were wont to
bring out their plays themselves, hiring slaves and freed-

longer ordor also The Stichus of Plautus, for instance,
according to the didascalia, was brought out by Τ. Publilius
Pellio, who is severely criticised by the poet himself (Bacch.
214 f.) for the manner in which he put the Epidicus on the
stage. '
