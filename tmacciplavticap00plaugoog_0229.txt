346. The expression “predicating characterizing,” found in my
notes, is adopted from Hale.

352. Mithly (Zeitscbst s. d. Oestemeiciisclten Gyrrrnasien, 38. p.
588) suggests hic celere ent for hoc cedere ud.

359. 'l'his line has heretofore been supposed to be corrupt. The
supposed metrical difficulty is commonly obviated hy writing monstra
for demonstro,· Lindsay retains demonstro, but writes doce for dice.
The line is probably correct as it stands; see my note and cf. Skutsch's
“Ausblick,’' on pp. 147 ff. of his Forsclrunyen.

387. See note.

392. Langen (Plautia. Studien, p. 274) would reject this line on
the ground that semper fecit is absurd, coming from a prisoner cap-
tured only the day before (cf. 110 44), and that such expressions as
are here found would nothe used by a slave.

394. num quidem: is commonly changed to nem equidem, on the
ground thatin the eight other passages where the phrase occurs it
takes the latter form. In Ps. 260, however, 0. has quidem, and all
the Mss. have quidem in the present passage. There seems no suffi-
cient ground for changing this reading.

395. Miiller (Rhein. Mus. LIV. p. 385) suggests mibi cum boc
(nureo). .

401. me icio ualere .· see Langen, Plautio. Studien, p. 274; Speijer,
Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 145. Nenoini (Sindi Italiam· di Filoloyia
Classica, 3. p. 84) suggests ui olibi et tu te ior coiere et terte.

403. me aduorsctum tibi: lsee no sufficient reason for changing
this reading of the Mss. It is in perfect harmony with (nos) inter nos
fuisse ingenio bared discordabili in 402. Tyndarus is dwelling upon
the mutual relations oi good-will existing between thern, and neque me
aduorsecum tibi is needed to carry out this idea after the preceding
neque tc commeruisse culpem.

417. meus esses.- commonly considered corrupt, but see my note.

418. The reading of the Mss. is commonly altered, but see my note.

420. uideas: for arguments in favor of the view that the subjunc-
tive never has the power of expressing ability, and that this must not,
therefore, be translated by cen see, see Cornell Studies in Classical
Philoloyy, VI. p. 198. For a counter argument, see Bennett, ib.
ΙΧ. p. 41.

430. quo miurus: one is strongly tempted to write quom minus.

430-445. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. p. 306) regards these lines
as an interpolation.

431. caueto: editors are wont to follow Bentley in changing to
