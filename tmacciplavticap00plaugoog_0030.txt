unknown. These eight were Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulula
ria, Captivi, Cerellio, Casina, Cistellaria, and Epidicus, and
these are preserved in a large number of extant manu-
scripts, dating from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.
A manuscript (D), containing some of these eight plays and
also the remaining twelve, was found in Germany about
1428, aud is now in the Vatican at Rome. It dates from
the‘twelfth century. The oldest manuscript (A) of Plautus
now extant, and indeed one ol the oldest Latin manuscripts
preserved to us, was discovered by Cardine] Mai in 1815, in
the Ambrosian library at Milan, and is known as the Ambra
sianpalirnpsest. It was written in the fourth or fifth century,
and is of course of great importance in establishing the text,
though it laeks the Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, and Cur-
culio entirely, and prcserves the other plays in amore or less

, incomplete form. Two other manuscripts (B and O) were -

used by Camerarius in the sixteenth century, one of these
(B, of the eleventh century) containing all oi the twenty
plays, the other (oi the twelfth century) only the last twelve.
A collation of a very important manuscript—viz. the one
used by Turnebus, a famous French scholar of the sixteenth
century -has reeently been discovered by Lindsay.1

22. Somewhat more than forty years after the discovery
of the manuscript containing the twelve lost plays, ap-
peared the first complete printed edition of Plantae,2 that
of Georgius Merula, published iu Venice in 1472· From
that time on there was an almost constant suecession of
editions of either a part or the whole of Planum, until
toward the end of the serenteenth century. Then iuter-
est in Plautine studies again died out and during the

¹Sonnenscheiu, however (Closs. Rev. ior May, 1899), expresses
doubt as to whether Lindsay’s discovery really represents the read-

ings oi the codex slbrneti.
²There was, however, a somewhat earlier edition of the other

eight plays.
