892. Bur-Niemeyer takes etiarn with qaam in the sense 01 even
aneu. nur (Am. Jourss os 110. 11111110) takes u tn us sense

not intend etiam to be taken with sancte, he would be guilty of un·
necessary ambiguity in assigning it to this position in the sentence.

901. i have followed the Mss. in making a new scene here, though
editors commonly follow Spengel (Saeuentr'tel, pp. 11011.) in recog·
nizing no division.

Fleckeisen, Neue Jahrbr'icberfor 1803, p. 1961. and 101 1896, p. 1771.
ln the present passage it is customary to write redducere, but thisis
against all manuscript authority, and against the uniform usage 01 ali
poete from Naevius on, including Plautus himself (ci, in the present
play, 437, 686, 9313 also Prol. 43). In Rud. 909 there is similarly
no authority 101 redducam, though editors adopt this reading. The
simplest way to remedy the metre is 10 assume, with Fleckeisen, that
te belongs after tuo.

to me, without adequate reason. See my note.
