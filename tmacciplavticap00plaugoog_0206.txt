820. petroni: Ergasilus probably has in mind the connection oi
this word with petra (πέτρα), e rocla, implying that the flesh is tough.

822. mortales: heines, creatures; as the word, however, is com-
monly used only oi human beings, mortales may be intended as a touch
of humor. ·

828. eugepeezledlctlonee: for the hiatus, see Introd. ᾗ 85.
aedilicias: the duties oi the aediles included the regulating oi the
traffic in the markets (the testing oi the weights‚ mensures, the quality
oi goods, ete.) and the care oi the streete. Ergasilus has been talking
as though these things were in his charge. hicquldem: always
sicquidem in Plautus. hebet: t's asaiam ef. orationem bebere, to

delioer err oration.

824. Plautus seems to forget ior the moment that his Hegio is him-
self supposed to be an Aetolian. mirum adeost: t't t's strange
enooyb; literally, it is strange to tbat deceta· cl. the similar English
use of “so” in the sense of “very‚'‘ eg. “it is so strange 1⁹³ For the
different senses of adeo, see note on 348. -

cibus is in appositlon with commeatus. inportu: ci. such English

because it is by bringing to Hegio the news oi Philopolemus’ arrival
in port that Ergasilus expects to iare so handsomely.

828. qul: ablative; see note on 28. adaeque. . . fortunatior:
see note on 700. This line is probably corrupt. As it stands, it can
be read metrically only by supposing it possible to scan qui bivaibi}
didoeqoe, or qul labimini ddlceqae. With bomine may be compared
milite (?) in Pseud. 616; carne ln capt. 914; pumice in Pers. 41;
pariete in Cas. 140.

829. illaec: for illo,· see Introd. §87 (b). illic: for ille; see
