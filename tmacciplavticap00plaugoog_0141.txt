plislt. nimisquamcuplo: seemstoheaiusion oi two expressions.
nimis capio and parom capio (how Itone). Perhaps, however. priam
is to be regarded as modiiyiog nimis, in which case triariis quom wtvuhl
mean how exceedinyly ; ci. Troclea, nimis quam puucce; Most. 1123,
nimis qaam catus. This verse is incompleta metrically ; see App.

103. recipit: yet back; in wlloquial language, the present is
sometimes loosely used where strict accuracy would require the future
orfuture-periect. nil est quo me recipiam: there’s uo troysor Q
tacet back, literally, there is nothing to retich (rebithcr) I raray leavle
‘ myself. Quo me recipiam is a volitive characteriziug clause. See
note on 12. ¹

104. This verse can not be read metrically and is probably corrupt.
iuuentutis: srom the young osea sese (emphatic ior se): rio
cae but themselves. omnis: in early Latin the nominative plural
oi i-stems often ends, as the accusative regularly does, in is. Later,
-es is the only form oi the nominative ; even in the accusative, the -cs

the principal exception aiter that time being oetaeis.

10⁵. lll(e) demum: but ther—e's casertanensem literally, be ct
length, etc. Demens is often best translated by laying emphasis upon
the word it immediately follows, which is commonly a pronoun or an
adverb. The e oi ille was probably silent in such cases; see Introd.
577. antiquis: good old,· atstiqois commonly refers to some-
thing that has long since passed away.

106. quiite: quoius became civiles about the beginning of the
Ciceronian period. Quoi seems to have been retained till much later,
to avoid confusion between cai and qai (see Quintil. l. 7. ai). See
Introd. ξ 86 (b). uoltum z see note on 8. gratiis: sor lzotliiuy,
varezocrded; pretiis was originally an ablativo ol cause, insaning out
os kineloess or favor, i.e. without reward, in which sense it carne to be
felt as an adverb (sometimes, though not in Plautus or Terence, con·
tracted to pratis· cf. dis ior diis).

10⁷. condigne . . . eius moratus moribus: endoval trith the
some scortea characteres lte, literally, oery (coll-l coortlu‘ ly character·-
ieed by his (ie. the young man's) character,· eivs is probably felt as
modifying both poter and moribas;'vvlren a word is thus used to
modiiy two words, its normal position is, as here, between the two
words.

109. und(e): ior the silent-e, see Introd. ᾗ 77. saturitate:
