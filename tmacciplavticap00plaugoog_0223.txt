APPENDIX.

Tuis Appendix isdevoted chiefly to references, comments, or expla-
nations that seem called for by statements made in my notes, or by
readings adopted in my text. It has been taken ior granted that users
of this book who are especially interested in the constitution of the
text will have aecess to all thc standard editions, with their manuscript
readings, critical notes, and appendixes.

Anouuurruu. 4. The various emendations oi this line seem to me
so uncertain that 1 have adopted none oi them in the text. Possibly
Plautus wrote coptum after notum (Brugmann).

5. Editors commonly avoid the hiatus by writing in ilino for inibi.

mse 2. 'ibe nrost plausible emendation suggested for illi qui
· ostent seems tome to be that of Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 138),
viz. non uili qnia stent, hut the reading is so uncertain that the best
course seems to be to follow the Mss. See my note.

ln' .· editors commonly read 1, but the manuscripts uniformly read
ln', which (with Bach and Leo) l have retained. For parallel instances
oi ille and llio, both referring to the same person, see depr. 1014, illic ’
fridicione secit; nam hunc en Alide nno reducimus; 111122, periurio-
rem hoc hominem siquis uiderit, unt ploriarum pleniorem quam illic
est; of. depr. llo-112, istos caprinos dnos, lieri qnos erni de praede de
quaestoribus, his indito catenes, etc. (according to the manuscripts„
ib. 733-731, obducite istum . . . iubete huie crassos compedes inpinpier.

10. putri huiusce: this line has hitherto been considered corrupt
and has been variously emended, but see my note, with references
the1e given.

optumumst: Lindsay (Tire Journal os Philolopy, 52, p. 287) thinks
that “absolute certainty is attached” to Leo’s emendation, optume
est. The latter certainly represents the regular usage in this sense,
but under conditions similar to those in the text, we might in English
say either “very wcll '³ or “very good,'’ aud it seems at least possible

that optumum est was occasionally used in the sense of optume est.
