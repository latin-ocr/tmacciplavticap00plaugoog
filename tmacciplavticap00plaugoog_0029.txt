all quarters, of the scattered and neglected plays of Rome's
Ι greatest comedian, Plautus. At any rate, some such eol-
lection must have been made by some one at about this
time. There is, however, no reason to suppose that it
consisted only of the twenty-one plays now assigned to
Plautus. Itis probable that other plays were extant and
were included in the collection, and that another gram·
marian published a critical edition of twenty-one of these
plays, including in this corpus only such as Varro had said
(see p. xv) were admitted by everybody to bc undoubtedly
genuine productions of Plautus. After publication, such an
edition must have become the basis of all Plautina study‚
an assumption which accounts for the fact that all the other
plays became scattered again and were gradually lost. The
text of Plautus must, by this time, have become very cor-

undoubtedly made3 to render it intelligible, frequent oom-

polations crept in, and the text became still further corrupted.
It should be notioed, however, that the corruptions dating
from this period are chiefly due to a lively interest in the
plays, while the earlier corruptions above referred to (p. xxii)
were due to carelessness and neglect.

21. The second century an. was characterized by a dis-
play of eruditiori, and a popular field for such display was
that offered by archaic Latin. Great zeal was shown in the
study of the early poets. The prinoipal representative of ⁴
the learning of this period is 0. Sulpicius Apollinaris. It
is possible that the non-acrostio arguments (see p. xxi) were
written by this critic. Plautus was, however, doomed to
be forgotten again. In the Middle Ages he seems to have
been practically unknown. Hrotswitha von Gandersheim,
an imitator of Terence, who flourished in the latter half of
the tenth century, knows nothing of him. At the beginning
of the fiftecnth century all but eight of the plays were still
