rma ra] ker 11. scara 2. 101

you are not willing to confess. acio: ii this is the correct reading,
this must be pronouneed acio. Perhaps Plautus wrote cio.

298. uolui: d-id wont; see Introd. ξ 99.

299. meam: mecm.

300. perdidi: differs from ancisa· in that it commonly implies
culpability.

301. lstrrnc me potius quam te metuere, etc: the intentional
ambiguity oi these words would be thoroughly enjoyed by the
audience. They may mean: (l) I see no reason now whyI should
fear him rather than y0u; (2) I see no reason why lte should iear
me rather than you, ie. that Ι would be untrue to him; (3) Ι see
no reason why Ι should iear him more than you should ; or (4) Ι see
no reason why he should fear me more than you should.

302. cum istoc: strIct logie would require capt istius opibus.

303. memini: see note on marciporis in 240. audebat: sc.
loedere from the following laedet. laedat licet: the two verbs
in such cases were originally felt as syntactieally independent, laedet
being a subjunctive of permission: lc rnoy offerri. It is permitted.
In the course of time the verb in the subjunctive came to be felt as
dependent upon the licet. Thereupon, to make this dependence clear,
etwas occasionally used before the subjunctive.

304. uiden: ie. uidesne. With the loss oi final e, compare qaia? Ι
ior quiae f (reip aot? ne being used in the sense oi pop); sin for
si ai; duo and soc for the earlier forms duce and fooe; etc, etc. An
intermediate step is seen in nempe and quippe, which were probably
sometimes pronouneed aemp and qutp (see App.), though the e con-
tinued to be written. humana : accusative plural.

305. fueram: ie. had been prior to the time of my capture. See
App. As Tyndarus is the son of Hegio, he is in reality telling the
truth, though he thinks he is uttering iaisehoods.

306. alterius: to be read citrium· cf. note 0118.

307. proinde ut: where we should expect tolera qualis, or the
like ; proinde co is unknown to Plautus. familiae: with especial
reference to the slaves oi a household.

309. hoc . . . nolueram: titis (ie. what Iam about to say) is c
practer about tobiclt Ι bod (ie. before the present opportunity presented
itself) been montiay you informavi (and Ι will now proceed to improve
the opportunity), unless percharae pop pompeis arisit me aot to. See
App. 011 this passage and also on 300. hoc te monitum: formonsae
with two accusatives, see B. 178. 1. d; A. dt G. 238. b; G. 376. Rem. 13 H.
412. The assumtive boc is one retained from the active construction.
