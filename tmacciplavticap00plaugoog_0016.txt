Χ INTRODUCTION.

tors, such as bragging soldiors‚ sponging parasitos, aud inse
lent sycophants, aro held up to ridicule. As compensation
for this narrower rango 01 subjects, appears invention 01 new
situations and 01 amusing complicatione out 01 which the
same ever-recurring characters have to extricato themselves.
In this respect the fruitfuI, untiring genius of tho poots 01
tho now comedy challenges our admiration, though our osti-
mato 01 them is basod upon more fragments from their plays
and upon Latin plays that aro modolled after thern.

Among the poets ottho now Attio ccmody, 01 whom thoro
woro moro than sixty‚ the most distinguished in the judgment
01 antiquity was Menander (342-290 no). Noxt to him,
Philemon, Diphilus, Philippides, Posidippus, and Apollodorus
01 Carystus aro to bo named as tho favorito writers 01
ccmody. 01 tho original productione 01 these poots only a
few fragments have como down to us. Wo have, however,
Latin adaptations from some 01 their plays in tho two great
cornio poots 01 Romo, Plautus and 'lerenoe

cf course the transition from theold 10 the now comedy
was 1 gradual one. It extended over a period 01 fifty years,
from tho Plutus of Aristophanes (presented first in 408 and
again — this time in a revised form and without chorus and
parabasis-in 388) to about tho tirno 01 tho Macedonian
sovoroignty (338). Tho bost known poeto 01 this period aro
Antiphanes and Alexis. Whothor wo should look upon this
soonllod middle comedy as forming a distinct typo by itself

may be questionod3 but at any rate the division into the ·

old and tho now is an important one, and oaoh 01 thoso two
classes is marked by well-defined characteristico.

,i The now comedy, in its development, coincides with tho
politica] declino of Grooce and with the gradual docay 01
hor art. Α1 compared with tho old comedy, it shows 11
many respecto unmistakablo retrogressiou. As 1 natural
result, however, 01 the conditione already indicated, it is freo
from that distinotly local coloring, which makes oven a play
