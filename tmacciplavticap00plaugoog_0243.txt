The Founduiions offatm.

A book for beginners. By Professor CHARLES E. Ennium, of Con
nell University. mmo, eloth, 231 pages. Price, 90 cents.

HIS book differs materially from most of the present manuals

for beginners in Latin. Its methodis, first, to present the
forms of inflection, and then to develop the principles of syntax,
following in both cases, so far as possible, the usual or‘der of the
Latin grammars. Such rules of syntax as are needed for reading
and writing simple sentences are given in the earliest lessons‚ so
that the pupil has constant drill on the forms while acquiring
them3 but the systematic study of general syntax is postponed
till the pupil shall have mastered the forms and shall be ina
position to apply the rules.

The vocabulary of the Exercises consists of the 750 words in
most frequent use by Caesar and Nepos, and will serve equally
well as an introduction to either author. The Latin sentences
are for the most part taken directly from Caesar's Commentaries,
with such slight changes as may be needed to adapt thern to the
pupil's advancement.

The Exercises are followed by eighteen pages of easy and
interesting selections for reading.

Fredetic T. Farnswortls, Sanborn Seminane Kingstom N.H..· l agree
with the author in his preface that it is better to bring together “things
that naturally belong together‚'’ and to have the first-year book follow
substantially the order and form =of the grammar. Tne later and fuller
study of the grammar itself is greatly facilitated by a systematic arrange·
ment such as that followed in this book.

1². P. Donnelly, 8.J., College of tlte Holy Cross, Worcester‚ Mass.:‘1he
book has been appropriately named. l have never seen iu one volume
so complete a presentation of all that is necessary for a beginner in Latin.

Jamee flend, Academy, Sumit, N.J..· l commend the work most heartily.
lt marks a return to the common-sense method of teaching Latin to '
beginners‚ and is a thoroughly practical book. l do not hesitate to place
it in the front ranlr of books of its class.

c. Κ. Bartholomew, English and Classical School, Cincinnati, orio: We
are well pleased with The Foundations of Latin now ou trial.

Frank D. liuddock, Superintendenr‚ Hollancl⁸ Mich. .· 1 arn using Bennett's
Foundations of Latin with great satisfaction.
