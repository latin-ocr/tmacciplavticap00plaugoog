01 (1111010100, but it came to be felt as an adverb. mauelim: the
mlier form 01 molius ,· the subjunctive would be used here even in an
independent clause; incidentally it may serve here to characterize
the antecedent 01 quoru (forming apredicating characterizing clause

nuuc est iiie dies quoru pierio 00011000 sese Nobis ostendat, si uiui-

case), cu evodiup. A similar phenomenon is occasionally met with
in English, in expressions like ‘⁶ there’s no evading death,’‘ where the
use 01 “110” shows that ‘⁸ evading'' is felt as a substantive, while
the use 01 “ death,'‘ instead 01 “ 01 death,” shows that “ evading ” is
felt as partaking also 01 0 verbal nature; see lutrod. § 92 (a). The
pun in exitium exitio is inimitable. neque adeo : uor pet ; see note

in Latin except in certain subordinate clauses (eg. in subjunctive
clauses introduced by autequam, priusquam, demasic). See App.
