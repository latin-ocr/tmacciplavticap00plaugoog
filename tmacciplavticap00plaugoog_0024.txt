14. It is not to be wondered at that the earliest writers,
in adapting the productione of foreign genius to Roman earn,
should give them something of a native character, and we '
accordingly find that all the plays of Plautus bear Latin
titles (Asinaria, Aulularia, Captivi, eta), except in plays
like the Amphitruo and the Epidicus, where the title is taken
from the Greek name of a person in the play. Attentiou
has already been called to the fact that the plays oi Plautus
abeund in Roman allusione. Later, however, as the influ-
ence oi Greek culture came to be more widespread, there
was an ever-increasing tendenoy to make the Latin plays
more nearly like the Greek from which the plots were taken.
indeed, the contemporaries of Terence, among them his chief
adversary, Luscius Lanuvinus, made it a point of attack that
hc sometimes departed so far from his Greek original as to
weave into the general plot of his drama such soenes from
other Greek comedies as particularly struck his fancy. This
process oi oornbining parts of different plays into one was
maliciously called contaminatio. Except in this one respect,

to the third, eto.
