151151 11 my notes was suggested by Fay (Classical Reuien for 1894, p.

391), who, however, accepts insputatur as 5 probable correction. He

extends his interpretation to innutanter and insputari in 553 and 555.

In this homey be correct, but his objection to the transitive use

oi insputo, though serious, is not insurmounteble. Other similar,
compounds are found with the accusative, eg. 1115151115, inuoco (liter-

ally, 15 5511 upon 5151).
