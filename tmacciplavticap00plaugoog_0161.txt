(cf. “ as a matter of fact ³³). Such an expression following a statement
implies that what has been already alleged is not true, hut that what fol-
lows is, This relation between what follows and what has preceded is
thus one of opposition, and nernrn at length cameto be felt merely as
an adverb equivalent to bnt. frugist (ie. strepi est): le good for
anythlnp; srnpl was originally felt merely as a dative of service from
sinc (cf. Pseud. theramenem srnpl bonne), sor nee; but as sor rese
practically meant neesnl, this dative came to be regarded, and used,
as an indeclinable adjective, meaning proper, honest, discreet, etc.

with this use of probe, cf. the English expression “a qood th1·ashing.'¹

2⁷0. quid tu: qnid and qnid tn are frequently used merely to
secure the close attention of the person addressed to a question about
to be asked, performing the same iunction as the English “ how is it l ”
“ say l ” “ by the way !” or the like. With tn, probably po particular
verb was felt to he omitted; it merely stands in a general way as the
subject of action. mauells: represents exaotly thesaure use of the
subjunctive as in uelim (I should lille).

2⁷1. quod sit: which wortld he. If the qnod-clause were used ln
the sense of ethich ie, the indicative would here be used, as it would
, then be either a determinative clause (the particular one os these
alternaticee aohlch, etc), or one equivalent to sl with the indicative
(whatever is, i.e. is crtytht'np te, etc, thet is what I tentet). In the
latter case the characterizing idea, no matter how prominent, would
not give rise to the subjunctive. See Appendix to Bennelt’e Latin
(frenamur, § 402, with the references there given. longincum:
one would expect incalescentem the adverb gives the degree to which
the idea oi eit c malo istrue, the adjective would ascribe to the ante-
cedent of qnod a characteristic (e malo lonyleeuntnrn).

2⁷3. erat: Philocrates used the perfect snit in the preceding
verse; the imperfect here shows that his mind is wandering back
and dwelling, as it were, amid the former soenes. 'quam sl essem:
one might expect scissent, but quarn ei here follows the same con-
struction as when it means ce ey (cf. note on qncel in 181), the im-
perfect here representing the present tense thrown back into the past.
In early Latin, however, the present subjunctive is apparently ire-

quently used in unreal present conditione and the imperfect iu unreal
