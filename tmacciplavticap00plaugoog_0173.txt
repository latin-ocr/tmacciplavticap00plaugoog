396. mora: waste os time.

397. ut. . sedimen: that he isto redeam. nostmm. . ambo-
rum uicem: in mahange sor both os us, nostrum being a partitive
genitive. Tyndarus is slyly pleading ior himself, without arousing the
suspicion oi Hegio. Compare such expressions as ineam tricent, ia my
stead, oa macescunt (Plaut. Most. 355), tuam uticem (Cic. Fam. XII.
23. 3). Bennett (Lat. (iram, Appeoclix, 310. 3) thinks that uicem
was originally an accusative of appositior (= cs aa exchuoge), and
cites the present passage and Most. 355 as supporting this view.

400. suos quoique carus: every man lones his own sco ; literally,
his own soa is decr to each. numquid allud uls, etc: a common
formula ior closing an interview3 see note on 191.

401. me hic ualere: Tyndarus wants to put in an effective plea
ior himself, but has some hesitation as to how he can proceed without
arousing the suspicion oi Hegio. He is accordingly somewhat confused
at first by Philocrates' question, indicating, as it did, that the interview
was about to close. This confusion causes him to repeat aimlessly the
same words he has just used (391), me hic alolere; but he suddenly
rises to the occasion, and launches holdly out into words that will sound
innocent enough to Hegi0, but 'which are intended as a plea tc Philo-
crates to remember the fidelity oi his slave, thus left a prisoner. This
effort oi Tyndarus is a masterpiece. lt is iully matched, however, by
the reply of Philocrates. tute, etc: tu alone would commonly be
emphatic; the enclitic -te makes it doubly so. The unusual emphasis
seems to imply that the information about to be given would commonly
he furnished by the master about his slave, rather than by the slave
about himself. In this case, however, you (slave though yart ore) are
to pat oo a holdscce cod tell him Q dicito: see note on 11.
Here the act is not to take place till the supposed Tyndarus has reached
his destination.

402. misse: ie. cessasse.

403. ms aduorsatum tibi: see App.

404. gessisse morem: aava done the will (complicet with {hta

tion of tamea, ci. 187, 393.
