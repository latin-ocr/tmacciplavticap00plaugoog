xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

2. Tnoanm.

⁵2. Any one of the substitutes allowed in iambic verse:
for the pure iambus may, except as indicated below, als«
stand here for the pure trochee, L υ, the metrical accen·
being, however, in all caseS, upon the first syllable of th«
foot.

53. 'l'roohalo octonarius (Tetrameter Acataleofio). — This
verse is used only in lyric parts of the playS, in connectior
with other verses, to form special rhythmic systems.

54. The caesura is (α) usually after the fourth foot, fron:
which foot the dactyl is then excluded3 (b) sometimes ir
the fourth or fifth foot. In this verse a tribrach, a spondee¹
or an anapaest is allowed even in the eighth foot.

⁵5. Trochaic octonarii are peculiar to those parts of ε
scene that are intended to be sung. The movement of this
verse may be illustrated by the following z —

‘⁶ Beams of moon, like burnIng lancee, through the trec-tops flash and
glisten.'’

56. 'l'roohalo septenarius (Ten-ameter Cataleofic), called
septenarius because only seven feet are complete, though it
really contains seven and a half feet—This is a favorite
verse with Plautus. The caesura may be (a) after the
fourth trochee, in place of which a dactyl is not then ad-
missible3 (b) after the fifth arsis, generally with a minor
caesura after the fourth thesis or the third arsis. In this
verse, as in iambic verse, an anapaest is very rare immedi-
ately after a dactyl. The seventh foot is commonly kept
pure, though a tribrach or a dactyl is occasionally found.
The last syllable of the verse may, as usual, be either long
or short.

Trochaic septenarii are suited to a somewhat more quiet,
peaceful frame of mind. Compare : —

‘⁴ Tell me not in mournful numbers, life is but an empty dream.”
