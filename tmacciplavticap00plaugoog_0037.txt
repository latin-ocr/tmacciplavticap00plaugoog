35. The matres found in Plautus are chiefly iambic,
trochaic, anapaestic, cretio, and bacchio. A peculiarity of
iambis, trochaic, and anapaestic verses is that they are, at
least in Greek poetry, measured by dipodies, ie. pairs of
feet, instead of by single feet, each dipody having one main
and one subordinate ictus. Accordingly, averse of four
fectis called a dimeter (instead of a tetrameter), one of six

feet a trimeter (instead of a hexameter), etc. Frequently,

however, and especially with reference to early Latin
poetry, these verses are called quaternarii, senarii, etc,
names given them solely with reference to the number of
feet contained in each, the distinctions between the odd
and the even feet having been, for the most part, lost sight
oi by early Latin poets. ,

36. The verse of the early poets has always presented
many difficulties. Even in the time of Cicero the most
common and least difficult of these metres-namely the
iambic senariae—was apparently but little understood.¹
After a time the plays came to be actually written as so
much continuous prose. In most of our manuscripts of
them, no attempt is made to divide the text into verses at
