't'6 NOTES. [Psoal Ι

socero ln this sense; when soccos means money-tay, it standsfor
wenlth instead oi beggary. licet: ie. he may taire to day-labor.

91. mihi na ι note the emphatic position ol mihi (see Introd. ξ 99).

92. meus: meas. rex: patron, as olten; ci. 8253 Asia. 919;
stow. 45& Ter. Phorm. 338, eto.; βασιλεύς is similarly used in Greek
eornody. est potitus hostium: sall toto the hands os the enema·
liternlly, roos brought into the power os tlte enemy, the genitive de-
pending upon the idea oi potestas (or some similar substantive)
implied in the verb. Est potitos hostiam ismerely the passive form
of tho construction seen in Amph. 178, eum potierit pater Scrutaris,
tire ,rather brought him into tho power os Seruitus (i. e. reduced him to
slavery), which would in the passive have been is potitos est a patre
Seruianum· cf. Oopt. 144, 762; apio. toa, hostiam est potita; Lucr.
lv. 766.

93. ita: i.e. with such deplorable results. See App.

See App.; also notes on 466, 532, and App. thereon. ln arido: an
explanation cl illio.

96. quae aedes: the antecedent aedes, which would be in appo·

the relative clause, ethich house for α house which. lamentariae :
occurs only here.

98. nunc: the sentence begun in 92 (postquam oseas rex, etc.)
is leit unfinislred. This is probably not due so much to the poet's
carelessness as to an attempt to imitate the style of daily conversation.
hic: apparently an early instance ol long t' in this word; it is regularly
short in Plautus. See App. occepit: an early compound replaced
in classical times by incipio.

99. inhonestum: slave dealers were, as a class, despised. Very
respectable Romans however (eg. Cato the Rider), seem sometimes
to have speculated in slaves ; see Plut. Ooto Maior, 21.

101. qul mutat: see note on 28.

102-107. See App.
