82 rores. [mere

the subjunctive quisleuses, quom itself being a relative (from the
same root es qui) with some iorm of tempas understood as its ante
cedent. For prom with the indicative, see Oist. 115, sinc trabi, quom
epomet trabor; Amph. 753, ta proque etiam breonis, quom id me inter·
ropos ; 1134, quom sum lippum dape 216, 280, 423, etc. Even proe-
serh'm quom tekes the indicative, e.g. Asin. 80. The subjunctive in
the present passage may be due to the dependeuce of the quom-clause
upon aniniinitive. ,

14⁷. per: originally equol, then equal to tle repatrearents of tie
case, i.e. erritoble, proper, natural (as here). quoi : see note on 106.

148. aha, Hegio: for the non-elision‚ see Introd. 5 74, and ci.
851. See App.

149. dixis . . . induxis: ior the more commonstrem, indure-

rr's (see note on 124). Such archeic subjunctive forms are used only
with future meanings; they never refer to the past as forms like
diteris, laedereris, ete, frequently do (eg. in result clauses).
animum lnduxls: the two words are felt as constituting e single
verhal conception (brino tbe mitid to, i.e‚ resolve upon, or thiale) and
as such may take a direct object; here istricis the object oi enimam
imiteris, as wellas ol dieis. cf. unimam aduertere and animum
attendere, expressions which were similarly used with e direct obieci
and the former oi which was ultimately lused into e single word,
arriraaduertere. tuom: see note on seruos in 8.
- 151. malum: in an emphatic position ; one might be expected to
interest himself in a friend's prosperity, but his missoriano-you
stand by him even ιἰι that. quom: commonly interpreted as causei,
in which use it regularly takes the indicative in Plautus (see note on
146). itis possible, however, that quom is here equivalent to an
explicative praed, that, the sect thot. This use was entirely distinct, in
both origin and development, from the temporal or carrsal quom (oum)
end was always associated with the indicative. lt is very common
ln early Latin and is not inirequent in classical times, especially after
such expressions as protutor, pretias ayo, etc. See App. 1r the quom
ln this passage is explicatus, the quom-clause will here be the direct
vrlrlcct ol laudo: Ieommend your maleine your sriead’s missoriano
pirro· oren. The common interpretation makes it necessary to supply
ab object for laudo.

led-16⁷. See App.

151. nunc: he. his present plens for recovering his son promise
wisa, eheu: ior the hiatus, see Introd. §85 f. Here, again, b
