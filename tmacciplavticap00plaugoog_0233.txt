authority ought always to be respected until it has been clearly
proved to be impossible. Furthermore, the presence oi duplam in
the Mss. would be difficnlt to account ior, ii we suppose that dupla
was originally written, as depromis the difficilior lectio ,· it would
never have occurred to a scribe to write duplam cyniram, double
lamb, ii he had found duplo in his Msz, since dupla and duplum were
used oi price commonly enough to bave occasioned no difficulty.

(4) Finally, the parasite is complaining about the quality oi
things, not about the price ; note, ior instance, foetidos (813), petroni
(820). The price of iood never werries a parasite.

The interpretation offered in my notes avoids all ci these difficulties. .
Aenos Is the object oi locant, just as stateram is, in locent statuam sc-
cicndcm ,· the only difference is that the lambs are contracted ior asfit
to be elcaybtered ,· the statue as one ic bc mode. In neither ease does
locant imply that anything already iu one's possession is to be bonded
ouer to some one else3 it implies, in either case, merely a contract ior
something not yet ln one's possession. The locator, as Hallidie says,
may be either the party who pays, or the party who is pald, according
to the nature oi the contract. ln the present passage thelonei are the
parties to be pald (by the public, with the understanding that the lamb
is to be young and tender). For another instance oi caedundus in the
sense oi fit to bc killed, sot see rial. 567.

840. The Mss. end this line with coli irascier, which both destroys
the metre and is inappropriate. Probably these words have crept in
from 845, displacing what originally stood here.
