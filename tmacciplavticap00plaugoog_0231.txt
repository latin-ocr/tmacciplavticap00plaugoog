518. Regarded by Karsten as an interpolatim.

519. On the anticipatory subjunctive, see Hale’s The Anticipotory
Subjuaecioe 111 Greek aad Latia (Uala. cs unleapo Studien ia Classe·-
col Philoloyy, L).

521. Regarded by Karsten asan interpolation.

524. opertu . . . aperta aaut: Karsten regards these words as an
interpolation.

52⁷. uenit modo Ι intro: with our imperfect knowledge ol the
restrictione of hiatus, it is as well to allow it at this unusual place
in the verse as 10 aller the reading of the Mss. Additional doubt,
however, is caused by the anapaest in the seventh foot.

5³2. ineptias inopine: Leo (Plautia. Forsch. pp. 224 ii.) shows
that final s is much more frequently disregarded in Plautine verse
than ,has been supposed. After a short vowel, it may not only
be disregarded before an initial consonant ol a following word, but
it is often elided also before an initial vowel (see App. 466), as 111
continued to be in classical times. 111 lines like the present one (Leo
cites numerous others, p. 297 1.), 11 may be thats was similarly elided,
though preceded hya long vowel (justas m was elided, without
regard to the length of the preceding vowel). Le0, however, excludes

111011 an hypothesis as inadmissible. Possibl y we should read 111111111ἇο
i'nlcipisse.

536. Ι have followed Leo in letting 01111 begin this verse. In the
Mes. it ends the preceding linc, where 11 cannot possibly stand.

541. See App. 152. There can be no doubt that the subiunctive is
frequently used in Latin to express the idea of obligation or propriety,
where the only correct translation is made hythe use of 11011111, oepit

10, 01 some equivalent expression3 see Cornell Studien lu Classical
Philolopy, VI. Part 111.

547. Itis not necessary 10 make any emendation here. See note.
To change bic to istie destroys the alliteration, which seems intentional.

550. epulatur: it seems to me that editors have changed this 10
inputatae without sufficient reason. We know next to nothing about
the usage of either oi these words, and in the face of such ignorance
it is wiser to 101 the reading of the Mss. stand. The fact that
spato occurs once in Plautus and once in Ovid in an active form is
hardly sufficient evidence for reiecting 1111111111 here as a collateral
deponent form. Verbs which are found in both active and deponent
forms, even in the same author, are common; see, for instance, diction-
aries under proficiscor, proficisco ,· amplexor, amplexo ,· 1011101, sorite ,·
10011101, 00111110; and many others (see Introd. §⁸9)· The interpre-
