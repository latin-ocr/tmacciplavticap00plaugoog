88 NOTES. [Puer ll

192-193. ratiunculam, quantillum: there is a humorous touch
here that has commonly passed unnotioed. Just before meeting
Ergasilus, llegio was on the point oi going at once to his brother's.
But as soon as he finds that he will have to entertain Ergasilus, he
changlle his mind and goes to his bank instead. The diminutives show
how little the balance seems to him, when he refieots upon the appe·
tite oi his coming guest.

19³. epod trapessltam: see Introd. 5 84. Perhaps, however,
the vl was silent (see App). trapessltam: commonly written
trapezitam, but it is probable that the character zwas not used hy
Plautus. This character was perhaps occasionally used at a very
carly period (oi. C. 1. L. I. 14, Coznuo, where the letter should, ac·
cording to Lindsay (see App), have the ordinary z-iorm ; also Velius
Longus [7, ὃ] Κ]); but ee (medial) ando (initial) were commonly
used in its stead. In the time of Cicero, zwae revived for the more
accvvrate transliteration of Greek words.

194. ire: where we should expect the future, but a loose use ot
tenses is common in colloquial Latin; cf. the English ‘⁴ said he was
going the next day,” instead of “said he would go,'' etc. dixe
ram: ie. had said prior to my meeting with Ergasilus; see Introd.
§ilo luero: I ’tv he off,· the future perfect, instead of the future,
emphasizes the promptness with which the aot will be completed ; see
Introd. ᾗ ilo. This rhetorical use ot the tense commonly indicates
emotional or energetio utteranoe. The more energetio form ot ex-
pression is sometimes chosen, apparently for metrioal convenience, in
cases where the energetic tone will not be inappropriate. See App.

ACT 11. SCENE 1.

195. ld: anticipating uos. . . exsequi, which is in apposition with it.

196. id: we should expect eom, but the speaker has in mind the
general conception, rather than the particular word cernentum. an·
imo Ι aequo: lor the hiatus see Introd. ξ 85. leuilor labbei:
for the shortening of the final syllable of lobes, see Introd. ἓ 84.

197. domi: for the shortened -t, see Introd. ἓ 84. ahaua:
synizesis; see Introd. § 78.

198. el. . . morigerari: to moire the best os it ,· literally, to hornor
tt, to pice io to it.

199. This line is commonly considered corrupt (see App.) As it
stands, it may mean ond by your qood behovior to moire tt. cosp sor
your muster otoo to control pou (aa well oo eoeier ond pleasanter sor
