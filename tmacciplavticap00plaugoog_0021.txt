HISTORY OF GREllK AND ROMAN OOMEDY. XV

to bring the old again and again upon the stage (see p. xx),
the comedies of Plautus long continued to be among the
chief attractions of the theatre. So great indeed was his
popularity that plays cf other writers were frequently given
out under his name, in the hope of insuring for them a more
cordial welcome. Thai he was fully conscious of the hold
he had upon the sympathies of the people is shown by the

stage was left unoccupied, then Laughter, Mirth, and Merriment, end
Verses numhedess, all with one accord burst into tears.)

and thirty plays. In iii.3. 1, Gellius records an assertion

of Varro that twenty-one of these plays were admitted by
all to be genuine productione of Plautus. These socalledl

Asinaria, Bacchides, Persa,
Aulularia, Mostellaria Eculeus,
Caprius, Meuaecllnu', Stichus,
Curculio, Mller Gloriosus, dilueremus,
Casina, Mercator, Truculeulus,
Cistellaria, Pseudolus,

and the luccianum which only a few fragments remain.

that Varro passed judgment upon the plays to which he referred,
whereas he merely recorded that coruscusu omilium Plauti esse reuse·
