from their own private means. Besides the games that were
thus celebrated on behalf 11 the state, there were also others
given on extraordinary occasions, viz. ludi funebres (11 ι11111-
11111), in honor of celebrated men, those accompanying dedi·
cations and triumphs, and those given as votive offerings.

24. Down to 114 rac. the dramatic performances took
place near the temple 11 the deity chiefly concerned in the
festivities.¹ Permanent theatres 11 stone, such as were laur
built on a scale 11 great grandeur, were as yet unknown„
When a play was to be produced, a wooden stage was erected'
for the purpose, and then taken down after the performance!
This stage was ordinarily built near 11111111 11111111 11111,1
11 slope, so that the rising ground might afford convenient
scats 111 the spectators, while those in 111111 would not*h
obstruct the view 11 those in the rear. On such a slope the ἰ
people assembled under the open sky. As no scats were
provided for their accommodation, they usually sat, or
reclined, upon the ground. The more fastidious sometimes
had stools brought 111 them from their homes, although
this was looked upon as a mark 11 effeminacy and was
even forbidden. ln 179 111, a stage 11 stone was erected
near the temple 11 Apollo, but this was of small dimensions
and was probably intended for use only attha ludi Apolli
111111. Five years later, arrangements were made, on the
part 11 the state, 111 the building 111 substantial, per-
manent stage,² but this, if it was actually built, seems
soon to have disappeared. In 146 11.1.,Ι1. Mummius built
1 complete theatra, provided with rows 11 scats, but this
was 11 wood, and was taken down 11111 each performance.
Finally, in 55 111, was dedicated the stone 1111111111 On.

forum. That the ludi Apollinares at least, in the beginning, wera
given in the Circus Maximus, is clear 111111 Liv. 25. 12, 14.
