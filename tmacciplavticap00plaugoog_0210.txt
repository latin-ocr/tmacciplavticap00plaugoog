146 uerus [riores

866. nidere: ie. uideris. mlqnidem esurio: it's sor myreis
(tn my oren interest) that I 'ne hnnpry. Ergasilus, in jest, pretends to
misunderstand Hegio’s ntibi as modiiying esurire (instead oi uidere,
as Hegio intended). Notice that mi in iniquietent is short, ei. mquidem
(920).

867. ιιιο arbitratu: es yon please, et nemptonum, expressinga
willingness ιο acknowledge the truth of the last words oi Ergasilus.
iacile patior: meant by Hegio in the sense oi I ree'dity grant tt, ie.
l know you well enough ιο grant that, when it comes to eating, you
are “ in it” ior yourseli only. consuetu’s puer: Ergasilus pre-
tends to understand Hegio’s words (facite patior) inan obscene sense,
I reedity subruit, and replies I suppose eo; pou hed the hebitwtteneboy.

868. Iuppiter. . . perdant: the use of perdent (perdet, perduint,
etc.) in cursus, though extremely common, is oonflned almost exclu-
sively ιο make-believe curres, that are not really meant by the speaker ;
hence the present tense is regularly used instead oi the perfect ; see
note and App. on 172. te hercle: Ergasilus begins as though about
to utter a curse against Hegio, in reply ιο the latter's curse against
him. All oi this is oi course good-natured raillery, and Ergasilus, aiter
au insinuating pause, substitutes ior the expected perdunt an utterance
oi a very different character, te becomes the subiect oi apere, instead
oi the object oi perdent. aequomst: an English-speaking person
would be likely ιο say, tt uorttd be proper, but it must not be supposed
that est in such an expression was felt as wc feel “would be.” The
Latin est means merely is; in the present passage, ior instance, the
conception is the proper tbtnp to do is ιο thenit nte (theretes ere due ne
instead ef curaer). See note on 61.

870. ιιιιιιο tu . . . places: ie. I am now ready to accept your iuvi·
tation. Heretoiore Ergasilus has had his doubts about the character oi
the dinner he was likely to get at Hegio’s (ci. 179 it. and 497) and has
been waiting and hoping ior a more promising invitation. Now, how-
ever, he ieels sure that the good news he isabout to announce to Hegio
will incline the latter to give him oi his best. post ιθιιιριιι : behind
ttrne; Hegio means that his misiortunes have left him in no moed for
aieast.

871. igitur: connected with the demonstrative pronoun ts, and
originally meaning, in thot cese, ut thet time; the ert-clause seems
here ιο be in appositior with the demonstrative idea in ipitnr:
in the following cese, viz. ty I buti corne sonte tinae apo, then, eta, ci.
Mtt. 772, quando habebo, tpitur dabo. Ipitur is sometimes used in
connection with detritio and dentum ,· eg. liud. 930, ubi tiber ero, igitur
