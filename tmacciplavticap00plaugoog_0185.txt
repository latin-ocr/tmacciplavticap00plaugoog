(cf. incipisse in the next line) or from some one else. One should
be careiul not ιο use “ can ‘' in translating such questions.

sal-5³2. maxumas. . . haereo: set aa saal (sorae) hapa piace
as aoasease, (sarae) tamsoalery. nugas inepti(es): ii the text is
correct, the s must be elided, or else we must read ineptias. See App.
incipisee: the speaker thus addresses himself in answer ιο the
questions he has just put to himself. No promising plan of action,
however, suggests itself at the moment, end in his despair he ejacu-
lates haereo, I'ra staca! But at the critical moment, as will be seen
below, a happy inspiration comes to him, and he rises to the occasion
(547 if). The initial h of haereo prevents elision.

ACT ΙΙΙ. SCENE 4.

533. quo. . . dicam: i.e.Iwonde1· in what direction that fellow
has hustled himself out of the house now 1 literally‚ ia rahel directior
shall Ι say that that sellow has, etc. ; but the use of a word of saying
under such circumstances is foreign to the English idiom. Cf. 268,

535. quid loquar: what aar I paiap to ray? The following
fabulabor and aepaha make it probable that laarlar also is here a ¹
future indicative, but the present subjunctive is much more common ;
ci. 531, qaid machinari· In early Latin the indicative (but commonly
the present indicative) is very common in deliberative questions3 see
noteon208.

536. omnis in Incerto: amris sometimes seems to have the valae
of only two morae and to have been pronounced d-mais. quid . . .
confidam? what caaddeace shall ipat? See App.

5³⁷. utinam. . . perderent: one might expect perdidissent of
an unfulfilled wish referring ιο the past. prius . . . quam
periisti: as perire frequently serves as the passive of perdere, there
seems to be here a play upon words: Othal the pods had lalrea poa
away before poa were “ talea away '² fram poarsalherlaad.

538. qni. . . transrhenensem is about as frequent as the
subiunctive in causet qai-clauses ; the indicative calls attention merely
