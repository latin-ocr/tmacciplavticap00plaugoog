were marked with the letter 0, ie. canticum, the first

kind (1), with the letters DV, ie. diuerbium, spoken dia ’

logue, without musical accompaniment. In the editions of
Terence, as may be seen from Donatus, soenes of apurely
lyrio character were marked M.M.0. (perhaps an abbrevia-
tion for mod-i muloti roatici); those merely recited with
musical accompaniment, simply 0. (though this rests upon
the opinion of ltitschl, Donatus giving us no information
on this point); those consisting of ordinary dialogue, DV.l
72. Sometimes there was music also before the beginning
of the play (before the prologue) and between the acts.
The music for the plays of Plautus and Terence seems to
have been oomposed entirely by slaves. The music was
given by a single fluteplayer (tibicen), probably by the
oomposer himself, with a double flute, or, perhaps we might
say, clarinet, as the instrument bore a greater resemblance
to it than to our flute. It was played by blowing into both
tubes at the same time. From the didascalice we learn of
four different kinds of these instrumenta: tibiae paves, in
which the two pipes were of equal length, tibiae impares,
in which they were of unoqual length; tibiae sevrcnoe, of
which but little is known, though they were probably of
equal length32 and duce dextrae tibiae, in which the two
tubes were of equal length and identical in key and note. ’

Regarding the lastmentioned tibiae, we are told by Varro
that the right tube was for leading (tibio ivrceotioo), the
left for aocompanying (tibio surrentino). We have no fur-
ther knowledge regarding the differenoe between the various
kinds of these instruments3 but we may be certain that the
choioe of instrument depended upon the character of the ,

¹ Indications of this system of marking are preserved in the Phor-
mio of Terence, before Act Il. Scene 4 ; see Ru. Mus. XXIX. 54.
