644. quin: as in 643. mam hoc certo certius: mere snrelp
“ser sure ‘' tbun this, the certe being merely a repetition of the pre
ceding adverb. Such a double comparative as meets certius is
not nncommon in colloquial language; ei. stret. 704, anapia dulcium
Men. tlt& Bacch. 500; and Shakspere’s ‘⁶ the more better assurance‚”
(Mirlsummer Nipbt's bream, III. 1. 21), and “the most nnlriudest
eut oi all '² (Julius Gener, 111. 2187).

64⁵. inda . . . a puero puer: from the time seben ne were boys
together ; literally‚ thence from c bey, α’ bon (himself). The phrase
n parere is merely a closer definition of inde. puer: in appositior
with Philocrates. This construction would commonly indicate that
Philocrates is still a boy at the time the sentence is uttered‚ bnt the
appositional construction is sometimes loosely used ; ef. Cic. de senect.
9. 30, Metellum mentina· parer ita bonis esse us'ridns, where puer does
not indicate that the speaker is a boy, but that he remembers that,
when he was a boy, Metellus had, etc.

64⁷. corpore: complexiva.

648. crispus, cincinnatus: cuith bair curly and scell crimped.
Crispus refers to hair naturally curly; cincinnatus ιο flowing looks
artificially eurled. conuenit: r't tallias, ie. your words correctly
describe the appearance oi the supposed Tyndarus, who has been sent
tolllis.

649. ut quidem hercle, etc: thet Ι, consonari itali, come ent
tedae rander crrepe'ees mest unfortunate! Such a clause is exclama·
tory in feeling, but is conceived oi as also expressing the result (hence
nt) oi circumstances; ci. Ter. Pheret. 772, ut stultissime quidem. ..
rean pessertmnsl tltct we beve rnennped taines lilce consternante seols!
The ntelause in our passage is sometimes explained as depending
upon conuenit, which Tyndarus is then supposed to use ior his own
purpose with the sense oi r't a's eprecd, but aiter conuenit in this sense
we should have had ane. . . processisse instead oi nt. . . processerim.
Conuenit nt with the subjunctive might express agreement as to
purposes that shall be attained‚ or determination that shall be carried
out, but not agreement as to facts or events that are past. ln
medium . . . pessume processerim: the phrase in medinm pro-
cedere is used oi a man going out from the privacy oi his home in the
morning to begin his day's work. There was a common superstition
that a man began each day either under good or under bad auspices,
the influence oi which lasted throughout the day ; cf. “getting out ol
the wrong side oi the bed.'' Pessunee here has reference to these aus
pices ; ei. Sciet. 459, auspicio hercle bodie optnrne eninr· sores ; Epiri.
