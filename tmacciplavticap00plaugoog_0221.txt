raca er] aer v. sonna 4. 151

1021. ἐι (ess): ior is, as regularly in Plautus and Terence.
gnate mi: see note on paterna· in 936. See App.

1022-1oas: such repetitions, ou the part oi one who is trying to
recall something almost iorgotten, are common pheuomena. See App.

1024. per nebulam: would be more appropriate within nterio-
nom regredior, but it is apparently felt as going with audisse· ci.
head. 463, quoe euasi per nebulam scimus atque audiuimus. The Η
oi Hegio makes the preceding syllable long. nocarier: when used
oi personal experiente, memini (to which ira mensorium regredior is
here equivalent) commonly takes the present infinitive instead of the
perfect. G.·L. 281. 23 Η. 618. 2.

1025. sit leuior: he relieved,· literally, be liutter.

1026. principio : strengthening the idea oi pree in praeuertier.

1027. inber: tractarent.

1028. quoi. . . leceris: as much as to say, you may well speak
of “giving ” to one who is penniless ; another attempt at a grim joke,
in allusion to Hegio's proposal to “give ’¹ (“ dent ”) him something.
Feraria is future perfect indicative.

After the close of the play proper, it was customary for one member
oi the company to come iorward, and, iu the name oi the company,
ask the audience for plaudits oi approval. ln Terence, the speaker
does this very briefly, with the words, aelate et plaudite, or simply
plaudite; but in Plautus, his address is commonly, as in the present
play, somewhat elaborate. It is possible that lines roas-1036 were pro-
nounced by the entire company in concert, instead ol hya single actor.

1029. ad: arith dae record 1ο.

’ 1031. pueri suppositio: as in the Praeclaram, in which play
Phronesium palms off upon Stratophanes a child, under the pretext
that it is hers and that he is the father oi it ; ci. also a similar case in
the Andria oi Terence.

1032. neque ubi: aor (cases) where. clam: often a preposi-
tion in early Latin, but in Terence only with me and te. In classical
times it was used only as an adverb.

1033. reperiunt: ic. in the Greek plays which serve them as
their models.

1034. ubl, etc: whereby (ie. through the inflaeace os which), a
colloquial use.

1035. neque odio luimus: aad hece aot hored yoa; literally, aad
aare aot been sor ortaoroace (to you).
