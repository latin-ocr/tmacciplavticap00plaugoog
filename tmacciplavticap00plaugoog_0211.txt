demam instruam cymen. olim: formerly, sooner, ie. before 1
had heard good news for yon 181118 : referring especially 1ο obi.

878. 88118111 et sospitem: sose and round ; et must be regarded
as connecting merely 1118 two 1811118 81 this couplet, the couplet 118811
being added as a unit 18 ninom ,· et 18 seldom used 1ο add the last term
81 8 series, when the other terms are without connectives.

8⁷4. publica celoce: pocket boot. 11111111 adulescentulum:
i.e. Philocrates.

875. una: with him.

877. in malam 18111·Ι 18 the derlee. ita. . . amabit, . . . ut:
this is a commen formula ior solemnly certifying 18 the 11111181 an
assertion, though the subjunctive ito. .. emetat is more common.
In the present passage the future indicative and the subjunctive are
found side by side; cf. condecoret in the next line. In the case cf this
future indicative, the conception seems to be, ia yoiny to blesa (lone) me
according 881 hare aanally seen (and, therefore, specle the irath),
implying that 11 I am saying that Ι have seen, when in reality l have
not, then I have no hope 81 being blest; hence, you may be 8118 my
words ars true. nancta Saturitas: St. Orumsnll ,· humorously
personified as the goddess whom the parasite serves.

878. itaque. . . cognomine: i.e. may l always be called Crani-
full with as much truth 18 the reality ; Plautus probably has in
mind here such names as Saturio (a parasite in the Persa has 11118
name). Cognomina seems here used as a general term, without
reference to its distinction, when strictly used, from praenomen and
laomen.

879. genium: 88οά onyel; see note on 290. ln calling Philopo-
lemus his qenins, Ergasilus is thinking 81 the sumptuous dinner 118 18
expecting 18 get in consequence 81 the former’s return.

880. Alidensem: Eleon; from Alia 181 Elis, correspondingtothe
Dorio ’Δλις 181 Ἦλις. ,111 τὸν Ἀπόλλω : μά 111Α1118 Greek is used
chiefly in negative caths, no, hy —, but occasionally‚ as here, 11 18
used affirmatively, yes, hy -.

881. gnatum: 88818188119, val τὰν Ktpov: (yet) by Ocra.
Cora is another name 181 Proserpina, the queen 81 the lower regions ;
but it was also the name 81 a town in Latium, a coincidence which
suggests to Ergasilus the idea oi swearing by several other towns in
Latium (Praeneste, Signia, Frusino, and Alatrium), as though they,
too, were goddesses. Ergasilus’ indifference 18 the real gender 81
these town names and the consequential airs he gives himself by swear-
ing ln Greek, instead 81 Latin, add touches 8111111181 18 the scene.
