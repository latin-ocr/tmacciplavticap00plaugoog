iv PREFACE.

gation that the ancient testimony, if any exists, cannot
possibly be correct3 (2) the conjecture must have been
sanctioned by the consensus of all competent critics. Until
these requirements are met, all conjectures should be con-

fined 10 critical notes. 11 10 better 10 leave a passage unin-
telligible, with the certain imprint of the centurias upon it,
than, at the risk of continuing the work of 1110 corrupting
hands that have wrought before us, 10 introduce mere con-
jectures that are 1101 01 such a nature as 10 command general
acceptancc. While, therefore, Ι believe Ι have duly consid·
cred all the important suggestions that have been made in
recent years so far as they bear upon 1110 text of the Captivi,
and while Ι have mentioned many of these 111 my critical
notes, Ι have introduced but few of them into my text.
Such textual criticism as I have allowed myself 10 indulge
in has been systematioally excluded from the main oom-
mentary and relegated to an Appendix, which is 010011111-
ized for the citation of authorities for statements made in
my notes, where such citation seemed desirable.

In preparing 1110 book I have had aocess to all impor-
tant editions 01 the Captivi ,· but I have consulted most
frequently those 01 Brix·Niemeyer, Goetz and Schoell, Hal·
lidie, Leo, Lindsay, Morris, and Sonuensohein. To all 01
these I hereby acknowledge my indebtedness for valuable
help. Ι am further indebted 10 Messrs. B. H. Sanborn&
Co. for their courtesy 111 allowing me 10 embody in the
present volume a few pagos from the Introduction 10 my
edition of the Phormio, 01 which they arethe publishers.

I must also express to Professor Ε. W. Fay, of the Uni-
versity of Texas, Professor Gonzalez Lodge, of Bryn Mawr
Collega, and Professor J. C. Rolfe, of 1110 University of
Miohigan, my gratitude for their kindness aud generosity
