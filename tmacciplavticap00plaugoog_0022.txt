While all 01 the twenty plays preserved to usare sabatae
palliatae, Plautus treated his Greek originale with consid-
erable freedom, and never hesitated to introduce distinctly
Roman allusione, and to recast in a mould 01 his own the
material offered him by his original, wherever he thought
that by such recasting he could add to the humor or interest
01 the play. For the points 01 eontrast between Plautus
and Terence in this and other respeets, 888 p. xix ff. As
already indicated, the popularity 01 Plautus among his con-
