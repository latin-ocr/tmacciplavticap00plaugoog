32. nil: see references in note on aii in 16, and quippiam ln 111,
nil. . . penit. . . dum parceret: hewaenotsaoiaao'shiemouey,
is ‹rrily he ruiyht aare hie eon (Sonnenschein), ie. he spent money
ireely in the hope oi recovering his son3 B. 310. I. parsit:
regularly in Plautus, antl oiten in Terence, ior pepercit.

33. mconcillare: originally meant ιο baua together again ; then
it earne to be used, as in the present passage, oi only one oi the
parties to be brought together, in the sense oi ιο hung back. This
latter meaning, however, is confined to early Latin

34. emit: the length oi the final syllable may be due to the
following lt, but not necefflarily, as thu vowel was originally long and
this quantity is occasionally retained; see Intm‘rd. ᾗ vi. de quaes·
toribus: although fabulae palliatae are, generally speaking, dis·
tinctly Greek in coloring, allusions to Roman lite are frequent in
Plautus, aud are found occasionally in Terence. Here (though it
must be remembered that the prologue may not have been written
by Plautus) there is a distinct allusion to the Roman quaestores, the
officere who had charge of the financial affairs oi Rome and accord·
ingly oi the disposition oi the booty and the prisoners taken in war.

35. hisce: an old iorm oi the nominative plural (see Introd.

Hisce shows this early -s, the -ce being merely the strengthening
demonstrative particle seen in liic (ior hice), illic, etc. Cf. illisce

36. quo paeto . . . amittat: a purpose olarise (not an indirect
question). amittat: very frequent in early Latin in its etymolog·
ical sense, ιο serici alnay (a, mitto). This original meaning weakened
to let pet away (uulutentioually)‚ i.e. ιο lose, its regular meaning in
classical Latln aud oric not unusual even in Plautus, eg. lines 23,
143, οιο.

38. illic: formasse Introd. § 81 (h). For the c, compare the
c ln hic and eoo iloto on bisce, 35.

33. huius: Ιιιῖιῖιες see Introd. ξ 19. illic: this is probably to
bu pronounced here as a monosyllable 1ιιο; see Introd. ξ 83, and App.
