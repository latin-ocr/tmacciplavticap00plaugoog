nauculam lv

(c) Pluperfect: The pluperfeot indicative is sometimes used
where the perfect would seem more natural to the
English idiom, Oopt. 194, od fratremque ire daeg-rom,
mos icero. The tense was, however, felt by the
Romans as a true pluperfect referring to time prior ·
to a more or less clearly defined point in the past.
Similar uses are not wanting in English. One often
hears a person say, in reply to a suggestion just
made by some one to whom he is talking, “I hadn't
thought of that‚'' ie. “had not a moment ago, before
you called my attention to it.'' It would on such
occasions always be equally appropriate to say, “I
did not think of that.'⁷ The choice of tense depende
solely upon the point of view.

96. Participles: The perfect passive participle is used in
the ablativo with opas est and amus est, eg. Oos. 502, cicino
mesenas opus, there ts need of accettap tte aeiphbor; liter·
ally, there ts need os the neighbor met.
