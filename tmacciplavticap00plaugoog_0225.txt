nrrnunrx. 161

85-87. Rozwadowski (Wiener 1811111111, 13, p. 324), following
Guyet‚ rejects these lines, but without sufficient reasom One is
tempted to follow Speijer (Mnemosyne, XVI. p. 139) in retaining the
eones, which the Mse. have at the end oi at‚hy1etting it begin 80,
οα111331111111(3) quirino, eto, and changing redierunt to rediere. But
it seems equally plausible to suppose that eones crept into the Mss. from
the margin, where some scribe had written it to make unmistakable
the meaning oi uenatioi.

89. potest: see Leo, Plautia. Forseb. p. 72.

90. Editors commonly omit ire and read ilicet, needlessly altering
the Mss. Instead oi reading nil ire detra, speijer (Miremosyne, XVI.
p. 139) suggests a’l ire intra. See Skutsch, Iombcakiirenny 111111
8111111131, pp. 12-11.

94. This linc is commonly considered corrupt, but see my note,
with references. Karsten (Mnemosyne, XXI. pp. 296 1.) regards
both 93 and 94 as interpolated. On the 31131311, before a following
initial vowel, oi a final syllable ending in s, see Le0‚ Plautia. Forsclr.
11122411.

102-107. Langen regards these verses as spurious (Beitrdpe, p.
206 ; Plautia. Studien, p. 271).

102. Α word must have fallen out from this verse, but it seems
impossible to restore it with any degree oi certainty.

104. nullast: Brix reads 1131111131,· Leo, nam 1111111 131,· but
neither oi these readings would have been likely to be corrupted into
the reading of the Mss. (1111111131). Miiller reads in iuuentute ,·
Ussing, inm internata others change the order ο1 words. Possibly
ipsi bas fallen out aiter sese, the scribe having looked away from his
copy aiter reading 3331, and, upon returning‚ mistaken the -si ο1 ipsi
ior· the last syllable copied. The difference between i and e in capital
Mes. is often almost indistinguishable. 11 ipsi originally stood in the
text, iuuentutis must have been read idaiatntis asin Most. 30, Ρ3.
2021313.

110. The colon 13 commonly placed aiter tu. As the caesura
comes after sis, it seems more probable that 11 13 to be taken with
what follows. Brix-Niemeyer suggests the possibility oi this, but in
the text retains the usual punctuation.

111. de: commonly changed to a by editors; oi. de quaestoribus

’ 11134.
