ries 40] Acr 111. sonna 5. 133

non hebere quot· commendarem capram. The condition here intro·
duced by est would logically precede the condition st. . . peribo.
redit: ior this looss use oi the present tense, see note on llo.

684. at: still.

688. ponere: eepose.

699, Achemntd: locatiye.

690. The verb oi the qai-clause is easily understood from the iol·
lowing periit; cf. Cic. Verr. IV. 53, cum aliquid e priuato nonnum-
quam, occulte auferebant. per uirtutem: ie. in a noble cause;
literally, by reason of his nobilita. periit, interit: there is com-
monly uo essential differente of meaning between these words, but
interit is hero used in a pregnant sense, implying that he still lives in
the memory oi his survivors.

691. exemplis: modis, as in Epid. 671, and often elsewlrere;
exemplem originally meant a model; literally, sonrethr'np tehen oet
(eximo). Such a phrase asiarco exemplo (As. 389), ester that model,
easily came to mean in that mermer; thus exemplem took on the
meaning oi orodes. The word is frequently used oi punishments that
make “ examples '’ oi the victims.

693. uel . . . nel: i.e. I care not for the particular word you use.
Vel was originally an imperative irom nolo, and indicates irecdom oi
choico. praedicent: irom praedicere· the quantity oi the penult
(see Introd. 539), as well as the sense, shows that it is not from
praedocere.

694. The metrical structure oi this verse is uncertain. The linc
is apparently corrupt. dicant: already ielt as dependent upon
interdico, but having its origin in an independent expression oi permis-
sion, they moy say (let them say, ry they choose). ninere: ie. te
aluere. The subject of the infinitivo is much more ireely omitted in
colloquial Latin than in more careful styles.

695. -laxis : see note on 124.

696. affore: i.e. enm offere ; see note on ninere in 694.

697. pro: the interjection.

699. ad patrem: ior opud petrem; see note on 49. SeeApp.

700. aeque mellus quoi uelim: sor whom I heve better wishes,
literally, sor whom I mich equally better. There is apparently aiusing
together here oi two expressions, vin. melles alone and oeque bene;
cf. 828, adaeque fortunatior ; Mero. 335, miserior nalletst eeqee3 Mil. ’
651; Oce. 860.

701. milri aegrest: ci. “makes me sick,'’ in the sense oi “dis
gnsts me''; adverbs are frequently thus used with est; eg. bene est,
